    "BERT Algorithm - for us \n",
    "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. \n",
    "BERT was pretrained on two tasks: language modelling (15% of tokens were masked and BERT was trained to predict them from context) and next sentence prediction (BERT was trained to predict if a chosen next sentence was probable or not given the first sentence). As a result of the training process, BERT learns contextual embeddings for words. After pretraining, which is computationally expensive, BERT can be finetuned with less resources on smaller datasets to optimize its performance on specific tasks\n",
    "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP)[1] and in computer vision (CV)"
