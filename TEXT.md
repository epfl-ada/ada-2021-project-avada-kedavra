The second topic that I would like to investigate concerns about climate change. I would like to investigate how is climate change represented in mainstream media, and see if its representation is in accordance with official reports like the ones from the GIEC. I would study the occurrence of worlds associated to climate change in the quote dataset, and seek further insight on the speakers. I would use another dataset, that could again be constructed using scraping and Wikidata, that clusters speakers in different categories based on the profession and/or education: journalist, scientist, politician, activist. This dataset would also contain whether the speaker is climate sceptics or not, and their political beliefs. This analysis could give us some insight on why is only a small part of the population aware of climate emergency. We could also focus our analysis around times of natural catastrophes.

Investigation of how climate change is represented in mainstream media and see if its representation is in accordance with official reports like the ones from the GIEC - fake news?.
Use of another dataset, that could again be constructed using scraping and Wikidata, that clusters speakers in different categories based on the profession and/or education: journalist, scientist, politician, activist. There could be a index for sceptisism (climate sceptic). The timeline of climate representation according to natural catastroph. 

Detailed plan -> 

What we want to do. Statistics maths on what we will do (egs ic interval why or null hypothesis why? etc.. )
Pure data analysis


That you can handle the data in its size.
-> work with data that we can't directly open 

That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
-> should we look for outliers? or like only plot the data and look the distributions ? 

That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
-> filter according keywords such as "climate change" "global warming" etc

That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
-> i guess it is like what ml methods are we going to use to do what

That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.
-> what we could have also done but to complicated, ex we wanted to look the climate change representation with genders or nationality or whatever but it is too complicated so we stick to work and date - for example
