0,Evaporation is a type of vaporization that occurs on the surface of a liquid as it changes into the gas phase.
1,The surrounding gas must not be saturated with the evaporating substance.
2,"When the molecules of the liquid collide, they transfer energy to each other based on how they collide with each other."
3,"When a molecule near the surface absorbs enough energy to overcome the vapor pressure, it will escape and enter the surrounding air as a gas."
4,"When evaporation occurs, the energy removed from the vaporized liquid will reduce the temperature of the liquid, resulting in evaporative cooling."
5,"On average, only a fraction of the molecules in a liquid have enough heat energy to escape from the liquid."
6,The evaporation will continue until an equilibrium is reached when the evaporation of the liquid is equal to its condensation.
7,"In an enclosed environment, a liquid will evaporate until the surrounding air is saturated."
8,Evaporation is an essential part of the water cycle.
9,"The sun (solar energy) drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, moisture in the soil, and other sources of water."
10,"In hydrology, evaporation and transpiration (which involves evaporation within plant stomata) are collectively termed evapotranspiration."
11,"Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed, allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can then rise up and form clouds."
12,"With sufficient energy, the liquid will turn into vapor."
13,"For molecules of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces."
14,"When only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is low."
15,"Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures."
16,"As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases."
17,This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling.
18,This is why evaporating sweat cools the human body.
19,Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapor pressure.
20,"For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly on a windy day than on a still day."
21,"Three key parts to evaporation are heat, atmospheric pressure (determines the percent humidity), and air movement."
22,"On a molecular level, there is no strict boundary between the liquid state and the vapor state."
23,"Instead, there is a Knudsen layer, where the phase is undetermined."
24,"Because this layer is only a few molecules thick, at a macroscopic scale a clear phase transition interface cannot be seen."
25,"Liquids that do not evaporate visibly at a given temperature in a given gas (e.g., cooking oil at room temperature) have molecules that do not tend to transfer energy to each other in a pattern sufficient to frequently give a molecule the heat energy necessary to turn into vapor."
26,"However, these liquids ""are"" evaporating."
27,It is just that the process is much slower and thus significantly less visible.
28,"If evaporation takes place in an enclosed area, the escaping molecules accumulate as a vapor above the liquid."
29,"Many of the molecules return to the liquid, with returning molecules becoming more frequent as the density and pressure of the vapor increases."
30,"When the process of escape and return reaches an equilibrium, the vapor is said to be ""saturated"", and no further change in either vapor pressure and density or liquid temperature will occur."
31,"For a system consisting of vapor and liquid of a pure substance, this equilibrium state is directly related to the vapor pressure of the substance, as given by the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:"
32,"where ""P"", ""P"" are the vapor pressures at temperatures ""T"", ""T"" respectively, Δ""H"" is the enthalpy of vaporization, and ""R"" is the universal gas constant."
33,The rate of evaporation in an open system is related to the vapor pressure found in a closed system.
34,"If a liquid is heated, when the vapor pressure reaches the ambient pressure the liquid will boil."
35,The ability for a molecule of a liquid to evaporate is based largely on the amount of kinetic energy an individual particle may possess.
36,"Even at lower temperatures, individual molecules of a liquid can evaporate if they have more than the minimum amount of kinetic energy required for vaporization."
37,"Note: Air used here is a common example; however, the vapor phase can be other gases."
38,"In the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized ""pan"" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide."
39,Others do likewise around the world.
40,The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.
41,The measurements range from under 30 to over per year.
42,"Evaporation is an endothermic process, in that heat is absorbed during evaporation."
43,Fuel droplets vaporize as they receive heat by mixing with the hot gases in the combustion chamber.
44,Heat (energy) can also be received by radiation from any hot refractory wall of the combustion chamber.
45,Internal combustion engines rely upon the vaporization of the fuel in the cylinders to form a fuel/air mixture in order to burn well.
46,The chemically correct air/fuel mixture for total burning of gasoline has been determined to be 15 parts air to one part gasoline or 15/1 by weight.
47,"Changing this to a volume ratio yields 8000 parts air to one part gasoline or 8,000/1 by volume."
48,"Thin films may be deposited by evaporating a substance and condensing it onto a substrate, or by dissolving the substance in a solvent, spreading the resulting solution thinly over a substrate, and evaporating the solvent."
49,The Hertz–Knudsen equation is often used to estimate the rate of evaporation in these instances.
50,"Rainforests are forests characterized by high and continuous rainfall, with annual rainfall in the case of tropical rainforests between , and definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests."
51,"The monsoon trough, alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth's tropical rainforests: which are distinct from monsoonal areas of seasonal tropical forest."
52,Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests.
53,"There may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests."
54,"Tropical rainforests have been called the ""jewels of the Earth"" and the ""world's largest pharmacy"", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there."
55,"Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover, sometimes misnamed oxygen production, processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration."
56,The undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level.
57,"If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of vines, shrubs and small trees, called a jungle."
58,"The term ""jungle"" is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally."
59,"Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation, the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere."
60,Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator.
61,Mean monthly temperatures exceed during all months of the year.
62,Average annual rainfall is no less than and can exceed although it typically lies between and .
63,"Many of the world's tropical forests are associated with the location of the monsoon trough, also known as the intertropical convergence zone."
64,The broader category of tropical moist forests are located in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.
65,"Tropical rainforests exist in Southeast Asia (from Myanmar (Burma)) to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka; also in Sub-Saharan Africa from the Cameroon to the Congo (Congo Rainforest), South America (e.g."
66,"the Amazon rainforest), Central America (e.g."
67,"Bosawás, the southern Yucatán Peninsula-El Peten-Belize-Calakmul), Australia, and on Pacific Islands (such as Hawaii)."
68,"Tropical forests have been called the ""Earth's lungs"", although it is now known that rainforests contribute little net oxygen addition to the atmosphere through photosynthesis."
69,"Tropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but temperate rainforests only occur in few regions around the world."
70,Temperate rainforests are rainforests in temperate regions.
71,"They occur in North America (in the Pacific Northwest in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California), in Europe (parts of the British Isles such as the coastal areas of Ireland and Scotland, southern Norway, parts of the western Balkans along the Adriatic coast, as well as in Galicia and coastal areas of the eastern Black Sea, including Georgia and coastal Turkey), in East Asia (in southern China, Highlands of Taiwan, much of Japan and Korea, and on Sakhalin Island and the adjacent Russian Far East coast), in South America (southern Chile) and also in Australia and New Zealand."
72,"A tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area."
73,"Examples include the emergent, canopy, understory and forest floor layers."
74,"The emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80 m tall."
75,They need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas.
76,"Eagles, butterflies, bats and certain monkeys inhabit this layer."
77,"The canopy layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically to tall."
78,"The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops."
79,"The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species."
80,"Epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants."
81,"The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse."
82,A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy.
83,"Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it."
84,"As long ago as 1917, naturalist William Beebe declared that ""another continent of life remains to be discovered, not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of square miles."
85,"True exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using crossbows."
86,"Exploration of the canopy is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of balloons and airships to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor."
87,The science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called dendronautics.
88,The understory or understorey layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor.
89,"It is home to a number of birds, snakes and lizards, as well as predators such as jaguars, boa constrictors and leopards."
90,The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant.
91,Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory.
92,Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory.
93,"This layer can be called a ""shrub layer"", although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer."
94,"The forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight."
95,Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region.
96,"Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration."
97,"It also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay."
98,Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.
99,More than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest.
100,"Rainforests support a very broad array of fauna, including mammals, reptiles, birds and invertebrates."
101,"Mammals may include primates, felids and other families."
102,"Reptiles include snakes, turtles, chameleons and other families; while birds include such families as vangidae and Cuculidae."
103,Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests.
104,Fungi are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals.
105,"The great diversity in rainforest species is in large part the result of diverse and numerous physical refuges, i.e."
106,"places in which plants are inaccessible to many herbivores, or in which animals can hide from predators."
107,Having numerous refuges available also results in much higher total biomass than would otherwise be possible.
108,"Despite the growth of vegetation in a tropical rainforest, soil quality is often quite poor."
109,Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus.
110,The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red colour and sometimes produces mineral deposits such as bauxite.
111,"Most trees have roots near the surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals."
112,"On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile."
113,"If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off and beginning a process of soil erosion."
114,Eventually streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible.
115,There are several reasons for the poor soil quality: First is that the soil is highly acidic.
116,The roots of plants rely on an acidity difference between the roots and the soil in order to absorb nutrients.
117,"When the soil is acidic, there is little difference, and therefore little absorption of nutrients from the soil."
118,"Second, the type of clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients and stop them from washing away."
119,"Even if humans artificially add nutrients to the soil, the nutrients mostly wash away and are not absorbed by the plants."
120,"Thirdly, the type of clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients and stop them from washing away."
121,"Even if humans artificially added nutrients to the soil, the nutrients would still mostly wash away and not absorbed by the plants."
122,"Finally, these soils are poor due to the high volume of rain in tropical rainforests washes nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in other climates."
123,A natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of carbon dioxide.
124,"On a global scale, long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, though they may have other climatic effects (on cloud formation, for example, by recycling water vapour)."
125,No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed.
126,"Human-induced deforestation plays a significant role in causing rainforests to release carbon dioxide, as do other factors, whether human-induced or natural, which result in tree death, such as burning and drought."
127,"Some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a large loss of Amazonian rainforest around 2050 due to drought, forest dieback and the subsequent release of more carbon dioxide."
128,"Five million years from now, the Amazon rainforest may long since have dried and transformed itself into savannah, killing itself in the process (changes such as this may happen even if all human deforestation activity ceases overnight)."
129,Tropical rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides.
130,Rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services provided.
131,"Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest."
132,"Also, plant-derived medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment."
133,"At the same time, rainforests are usually not used sustainably by non-native peoples but are being exploited or removed for agricultural purposes."
134,"On January 18, 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005."
135,"With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes."
136,The province of Irian Jaya or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.
137,"The tribes are in danger because of the deforestation, especially in Brazil."
138,"Central African rainforest is home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59 inches, on average)."
139,"They were the subject of a study by Colin Turnbull, ""The Forest People"", in 1962."
140,"Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as “Negrito”."
141,There are many tribes in the rainforests of the Malaysian state of Sarawak.
142,"Sarawak is part of Borneo, the third largest island in the world."
143,"Some of the other tribes in Sarawak are: the Kayan, Kenyah, Kejaman, Kelabit, Punan Bah, Tanjong, Sekapan, and the Lahanan."
144,"Collectively, they are referred to as Dayaks or Orangulu which means ""people of the interior""."
145,About half of Sarawak's 1.5 million people are Dayaks.
146,"Most Dayaks, it is believed thropologists, came originally from the South-East Asian mainland."
147,Their mythologies support this
148,"Tropical and temperate rainforests have been subjected to heavy legal and illegal logging for their valuable hardwoods and agricultural clearance (slash-and-burn, clearcutting) throughout the 20th century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is shrinking."
149,"Biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven to extinction (possibly more than 50,000 a year; at that rate, says E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, a quarter or more of all species on Earth could be exterminated within 50 years) due to the removal of habitat with destruction of the rainforests."
150,Another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding urban areas.
151,Littoral rainforest growing along coastal areas of eastern Australia is now rare due to ribbon development to accommodate the demand for seachange lifestyles.
152,Forests are being destroyed at a rapid pace.
153,Almost 90% of West Africa's rainforest has been destroyed.
154,"Since the arrival of humans, Madagascar has lost two thirds of its original rainforest."
155,"At present rates, tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in 10 years and Papua New Guinea in 13 to 16 years."
156,"According to Rainforest Rescue, an important reason for the increasing deforestation rate, especially in Indonesia, is the expansion of oil palm plantations to meet growing demand for cheap vegetable fats and biofuels."
157,"In Indonesia, palm oil is already cultivated on nine million hectares and, together with Malaysia, the island nation produces about 85 percent of the world's palm oil."
158,"Several countries, notably Brazil, have declared their deforestation a national emergency."
159,Amazon deforestation jumped by 69% in 2008 compared to 2007's twelve
160,"months, according to official government data."
161,"However, a January 30, 2009 ""New York Times"" article stated, ""By one estimate, for every acre of rainforest cut down each year, more than 50 acres of new forest are growing in the tropics."
162,The new forest includes secondary forest on former farmland and so-called degraded forest.
163,"A cotyledon (; ""seed leaf"" from Latin ""cotyledon"", from Greek: κοτυληδών ""kotylēdōn"", gen.: κοτυληδόνος ""kotylēdonos"", from κοτύλη ""kotýlē"" ""cup, bowl"") is a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant, and is defined as ""the embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants, one or more of which are the first to appear from a germinating seed."
164,The number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to classify the flowering plants (angiosperms).
165,"Species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous (""monocots"")."
166,"Plants with two embryonic leaves are termed dicotyledonous (""dicots"")."
167,"In the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves."
168,"However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct."
169,"Cotyledons are formed during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination."
170,"True leaves, however, are formed post-embryonically (i.e."
171,"after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant."
172,"The cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a ""scutellum"" and a ""coleoptile""."
173,The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent endosperm.
174,"The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the ""plumule"" (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant)."
175,"Gymnosperm seedlings also have cotyledons, and these are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with from 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the hypocotyl (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule."
176,"Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g."
177,"Monterey pine (""Pinus radiata"") seedlings have 5–9, and Jeffrey pine (""Pinus jeffreyi"") 7–13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g."
178,Mediterranean cypress always having just two cotyledons.
179,"The highest number reported is for big-cone pinyon (""Pinus maximartinezii""), with 24 (Farjon & Styles 1997)."
180,"The cotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant."
181,"The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the seed."
182,"As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin photosynthesis, or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling."
183,"Cotyledons may be either epigeal, expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or hypogeal, not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic."
184,"The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many nuts and acorns."
185,Hypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones.
186,"They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as meristem buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed)."
187,"The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive."
188,"The ultimate development of the epigeal habit is represented by a few plants, mostly in the family Gesneriaceae in which the cotyledon persists for a lifetime."
189,"Such a plant is ""Streptocarpus wendlandii"" of South Africa in which one cotyledon grows to be up to 75 centimeters (2.5 feet) in length and up to 61 cm (two feet) in width (the largest cotyledon of any dicot, and exceeded only by ""Lodoicea"")."
190,Adventitious flower clusters form along the midrib of the cotyledon.
191,The second cotyledon is much smaller and ephemeral.
192,"Related plants may show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family."
193,"Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the Southern Hemisphere conifer family Araucariaceae, the pea family, Fabaceae, and the genus ""Lilium"" (see Lily seed germination types)."
194,"The frequently garden grown common bean, ""Phaseolus vulgaris"", is epigeal, while the closely related runner bean, ""Phaseolus coccineus"", is hypogeal."
195,"The term ""cotyledon"" was coined by Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694)."
196,"John Ray was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to systematics, in ""Methodus plantarum"" (1682)."
197,Theophrastus (3rd or 4th century BC) and Albertus Magnus (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
198,"A lithosphere ( [""lithos""] for ""rocky"", and [""sphaira""] for ""sphere"") is the rigid, outermost shell of a terrestrial-type planet, or natural satellite, that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties."
199,"On Earth, it is composed of the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater."
200,"The outermost shell of a rocky planet, the crust, is defined on the basis of its chemistry and mineralogy."
201,The layer under the lithosphere is known as the asthenosphere.
202,"Earth's lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the Earth."
203,The lithosphere is subdivided into tectonic plates.
204,"The uppermost part of the lithosphere that chemically reacts to the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere through the soil forming process is called the pedosphere."
205,"The lithosphere is underlain by the asthenosphere which is the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle."
206,"The Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary is defined by a difference in response to stress: the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere deforms viscously and accommodates strain through plastic deformation."
207,The concept of the lithosphere as Earth's strong outer layer was described by A.E.H.
208,"Love in his 1911 monograph ""Some problems of Geodynamics"" and further developed by Joseph Barrell, who wrote a series of papers about the concept and introduced the term ""lithosphere""."
209,"The concept was based on the presence of significant gravity anomalies over continental crust, from which he inferred that there must exist a strong, solid upper layer (which he called the lithosphere) above a weaker layer which could flow (which he called the asthenosphere)."
210,"These ideas were expanded by Reginald Aldworth Daly in 1940 with his seminal work ""Strength and Structure of the Earth."
211,They have been broadly accepted by geologists and geophysicists.
212,These concepts of a strong lithosphere resting on a weak asthenosphere are essential to the theory of plate tectonics.
213,There are two types of lithosphere:
214,The thickness of the lithosphere is considered to be the depth to the isotherm associated with the transition between brittle and viscous behavior.
215,The temperature at which olivine begins to deform viscously (~1000 °C) is often used to set this isotherm because olivine is generally the weakest mineral in the upper mantle.
216,"Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50–140 km thick (but beneath the mid-ocean ridges is no thicker than the crust), while continental lithosphere has a range in thickness from about 40 km to perhaps 280 km; the upper ~30 to ~50 km of typical continental lithosphere is crust."
217,The mantle part of the lithosphere consists largely of peridotite.
218,The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity.
219,"Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of mafic crust and ultramafic mantle (peridotite) and is denser than continental lithosphere, for which the mantle is associated with crust made of felsic rocks."
220,Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge.
221,"This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly thick and dense with age."
222,"In fact, oceanic lithosphere is a thermal boundary layer for the convection in the mantle."
223,The thickness of the mantle part of the oceanic lithosphere can be approximated as a thermal boundary layer that thickens as the square root of time.
224,"Here, formula_2 is the thickness of the oceanic mantle lithosphere, formula_3 is the thermal diffusivity (approximately 10 m/s) for silicate rocks, and formula_4 is the age of the given part of the lithosphere."
225,"The age is often equal to L/V, where L is the distance from the spreading centre of mid-oceanic ridge, and V is velocity of the lithospheric plate."
226,Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere.
227,"This is because the chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, but thermal contraction of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere."
228,"The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at subduction zones, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental."
229,New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones.
230,"As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old."
231,"The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie cratons, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle ""roots of cratons"" helps to stabilize these regions."
232,"Geophysical studies in the early 21st century posit that large pieces of the lithosphere have been subducted into the mantle as deep as 2900 km to near the core-mantle boundary, while others ""float"" in the upper mantle, while some stick down into the mantle as far as 400 km but remain ""attached"" to the continental plate above, similar to the extent of the ""tectosphere"" proposed by Jordan in 1988."
233,"Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle xenoliths brought up in kimberlite, lamproite, and other volcanic pipes."
234,"The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of osmium and rhenium."
235,"Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics."
236,"The Australian Greens, commonly known as The Greens, are a centre-left, green political party in Australia."
237,"As of the 2019 federal election, the Greens are currently the third largest political party in Australia by vote."
238,"The current leader of the party is Richard Di Natale, and the party's co-deputy leaders are Adam Bandt and Larissa Waters."
239,The party was formed in 1992 and is a confederation of eight state and territorial parties.
240,"The party cites four core values: ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence."
241,"Party constituencies can be traced to various origins – notably the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group (UTG), one of the first green parties in the world, but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales."
242,Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests.
243,Key people involved in these campaigns included Bob Brown and Christine Milne who went on to contest and win seats in the Tasmanian Parliament and eventually form the Tasmanian Greens; both Brown and Milne subsequently became leaders of the federal party.
244,The Australian Greens' policies cover a wide range of issues.
245,"Most notably, the party favours environmentalism, including expansion of recycling facilities; phasing out single-use plastics; conservation efforts; better water management; and addressing species extinction, habitat loss and deforestation in Australia."
246,"The Greens strongly support efforts to address climate change, by transitioning away from the burning of fossil fuels to renewable energy production in the next decade, as well as reintroducing a carbon price."
247,"The party supports lowering household electricity prices through the creation of a publicly-owned renewable energy provider, and building thousands of new jobs in renewable energy generation."
248,"On economic issues, the Greens oppose tax cuts that solely benefit the top bracket of income earners and lead to socioeconomic inequality and believe that all essential services need to be adequately funded to suit community needs; and argue for the recreation of a publicly-owned bank."
249,"The Greens have campaigned on free undergraduate university and TAFE, paid for by ending tax avoidance and fossil fuel subsidies, as well as restoring funding to the education sectors."
250,"The party is in favour of extending Medicare coverage to dental and mental health care, and supports reproductive health rights and voluntary euthanasia."
251,"The Greens are often known for their outspoken advocacy on numerous social issues, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage, the right to seek asylum and gender equality."
252,"The party supports drug law reform, including the legalisation of cannabis; treating drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal issue; and community pill-testing."
253,The party supports animal welfare policies and stringent gun control legislation.
254,"The Greens also advocate for policies that they believe will strengthen Australian democracy and ""clean up politics"", including capping political donations and instituting a federal anti-corruption watchdog."
255,"Following the 2016 federal election, the Australian Greens had nine senators and one member in the lower house, 23 elected representatives across state and territory parliaments, more than 100 local councillors, and over 15,000 party members (as of 2016)."
256,All Senate and House of Representatives seats were retained at the 2019 election.
257,"The formation of the Australian Greens in 1992 brought together over a dozen green groups, from state and local organisations, some of which had existed for 20 years."
258,"The precursor to the Tasmanian Greens (the earliest existent member of the federation of parties that is the Australian Greens), the United Tasmania Group, was founded in 1972 to oppose the construction of new dams to flood Lake Pedder."
259,The campaign failed to prevent the flooding of Lake Pedder and the party failed to gain political representation.
260,"One of the party's candidates was Bob Brown, then a doctor in Launceston."
261,"In the late 1970s and 1980s, a public campaign to prevent the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania saw environmentalist and activist Norm Sanders elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as an Australian Democrat."
262,"Brown, then director of the Wilderness Society, contested the election as an independent, but failed to win a seat."
263,"In 1982 Norm Sanders resigned from the THA, and Brown was elected to replace him in a countback."
264,"During her 1984 visit to Australia, West German Greens parliamentarian Petra Kelly urged that the various Greens groups in Australia develop a national identity."
265,"Partly as a result of this, 50 Greens activists gathered in Tasmania in December to organise a national conference."
266,"The title ""The Greens"" had been first registered in Sydney in the 1980s by what ""The Monthly Magazine"" described as ""a band of inner-city radicals committed to resident action, nuclear disarmament and urban environmental causes, such as stopping expressways and preserving parklands""."
267,"The group formed as the Sydney Greens and evolved into the Green Alliance, with the stated aim of not forming a ""traditional hierarchy party""."
268,"According to party co-ordinator Hall Greenland, when amalgamation with Bob Brown's Tasmanian movement was first mooted, Brown was hesitant owing to what he perceived as the ""anarchic leftism"" of the Sydney movement."
269,The Greens NSW and The Greens (WA) were also wary of amalgamation owing to local autonomy concerns and a 1986 attempt by Brown to form a national party failed.
270,The movement for a national party continued however.
271,"In an effort to reduce the influence of the Democratic Socialist Party (formerly Socialist Workers Party, now Socialist Alliance) in The Greens NSW, Brown successfully moved for a ban on dual party membership by Greens in 1991."
272,"Following formation of the national party in 1992, regional emphasis variations remained within the Greens, with members of the ""industrial left"" remaining a presence in the New South Wales branch."
273,"The Green movement gained its first federal parliamentary representative when Senator Jo Vallentine of Western Australia, who had been elected in 1984 for the Nuclear Disarmament Party and later sat as an independent, was part of the formation of and joined The Greens (WA), a party formed in Western Australia, and not affiliated to the Australian Greens at that time."
274,"In 1992, representatives from around the nation gathered in North Sydney and agreed to form the Australian Greens, although the state Greens parties, particularly in Western Australia, retained their separate identities for a period."
275,"Brown resigned from the Tasmanian Parliament in 1993, and in 1996 he was elected as a senator for Tasmania, the first elected as an Australian Greens candidate."
276,"Initially the most successful Greens group during this period was The Greens (WA), at that time still a separate organisation from the Australian Greens."
277,"Vallentine was succeeded by Christabel Chamarette in 1992, and she was joined by Dee Margetts in 1993."
278,But Chamarette was defeated in the 1996 federal election.
279,Margetts opposed the industrial relations reform agenda of the Howard Government.
280,"Following the 'Cavalcade to Canberra' protest of 19 August 1996, in which 2000 breakaway civilians rioted in and around Parliament House, Margetts told the Senate that ""The Greens (WA) do not associate ourselves with the violent action"" and that while ""there are obviously some in the Greens movement who have differing opinions about that"" she personally did not think there was ""any justification for the use of violence to the extent that we saw""."
281,"Margetts lost her seat in the 1998 federal election, leaving Brown as the sole Australian Greens senator."
282,"The national party initially resisted appointing a party leader, however Bob Brown was later selected."
283,The New South Wales Greens remained ideologically opposed to appointing a leader and continue not to appoint such a position.
284,"The WA Greens had lost office in the Senate by 1998, leaving Bob Brown as the sole representative of the party."
285,"Thereafter, the national vote was set to increase consecutively at elections up until 2010."
286,"In the 2001 federal election, Brown was re-elected as a senator for Tasmania, and a second Greens senator, Kerry Nettle, was elected in New South Wales."
287,"The Greens opposed the Howard Government's Pacific Solution of offshore processing for asylum seekers, and opposed the bipartisan offers of support to the US alliance and Afghanistan War by the government and Beazley Opposition in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001, describing the Afghanistan commitment as ""warmongering""."
288,This contributed to increased support for the Greens by disaffected Labor Party voters and helped identify the Greens as more than just a single-issue environmental party.
289,On 19 October 2002 the Greens won a House of Representatives seat for the first time when Michael Organ won the Cunningham by-election.
290,"In the lead-up to the Iraq War, in September 2002, Bob Brown said that the Greens would oppose military action in Iraq regardless of the position of the United Nations Security Council and said that any conflict would be ""a vengeance for the S11 attack that's involved here as well as the American corporations wanting to get their hands on the Iraqi oil"" and that if Saddam Hussein ""does have weapons of mass destruction, the attack might be the thing that gets him to use them"", so it would be better to ""resolv[e] the Palestinian crisis, which could lead—open up a real avenue to peace in the Middle East, and neutralise Saddam Hussein by doing it""."
291,"In the 2004 federal election, the Greens' primary vote rose by 2.3% to 7.2%."
292,"This won them two additional Senate seats, taken by Christine Milne in Tasmania and Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, bringing the total to four."
293,"However, the success of the Howard Government in winning a majority in the Senate meant that the Greens' influence on legislation decreased."
294,Michael Organ was defeated by the Labor Party candidate in Cunningham.
295,"Additionally, in the 2004 election there was an intense media campaign from the socially conservative Family First Party, including a television advertisement labelling the Greens the ""Extreme Greens""."
296,"Competitive preferencing strategies prompted by the nature of Senate balloting (see Australian electoral system) lead to the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats ranking Family First higher than the Greens on their Senate tickets, and the Greens losing preferences they would normally have received from the two parties."
297,"Consequently, although outpolling Family First by a ratio of more than four to one first-preference votes, Victorian Family First candidate Steve Fielding was elected on preferences over the Australian Greens' David Risstrom, an unintended consequence of these strategies."
298,"In Tasmania, Christine Milne only narrowly gained her Senate seat before a Family First candidate, despite obtaining almost the full required quota of primary votes."
299,"It was only the high incidence of ""below-the-line"" voting in Tasmania that negated the effect of the preference-swap deal between Labor and Family First."
300,"The Australian Greens fielded candidates in every House of Representatives seat in Australia, and for all state and territory Senate positions."
301,"The Greens (WA) were able to win Legislative Council seats in rural and remote-area seats (Mining and Pastoral, Agricultural and South West provinces)."
302,"In 2005, the Greens' Lee Rhiannon lobbied the Vatican to reject Australian Cardinal George Pell as a candidate for the Papacy on the basis of his support for conservative Catholic moral doctrine."
303,"In 2007, Rhiannon referred remarks made by Pell opposing embryonic stem cell research to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in ""contempt of parliament""."
304,"Pell was cleared of the charge and described the move as a ""clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech""."
305,"The Australian Greens' primary vote increased by 4.1% in the 2006 South Australia election, 1.% in the 2006 Queensland election, and 0.7% in the 2007 election in New South Wales."
306,"The results for the 2006 Victoria election were mixed, with an improved vote for the Greens in the lower house, but a fall in their upper-house vote."
307,Against this upward trend was a swing of 1.5% away from the Greens in the 2006 Tasmania state election.
308,"On 31 August 2004, the Melbourne newspaper the ""Herald Sun"" published a page-three-story by journalist Gerard McManus entitled ""Greens back illegal drugs"" in the lead-up to the 2004 federal election."
309,"In response to the article, Brown lodged a complaint with the Australian Press Council."
310,"After the election, the Press Council upheld Brown's complaint."
311,"An appeal by the ""Herald Sun"" was dismissed and it was ordered to publish the Press Council's adjudication."
312,"As in previous years, the Greens' vote was strongest in inner-city seats, including Melbourne (22.7% of primary votes), Sydney (20.7%), Grayndler (18.7%), Denison (18.6%) and Batman (17.2%)."
313,"Strong votes were also recorded in Liberal-held city based seats such as Higgins (10.8%), Kooyong (11.8%) Curtin (13.4%) and Wentworth (15.0%)."
314,The primary vote for the Greens in suburban and regional areas was generally smaller.
315,"The Greens directly contributed to Howard's defeat in his own electorate, the Sydney-area seat of Bennelong."
316,Greens candidate Lindsay Peters received 5.5% of the primary vote.
317,"He was eliminated after the 14th count, and more than three-fourths of his preferences went to Labor challenger Maxine McKew."
318,This margin was enough to make McKew only the second person to unseat a sitting prime minister.
319,"The Greens increased their national vote by 1.38 points to 9.04% at the 2007 federal election, with a net increase of one senator to a total of five."
320,"Senators Bob Brown (Tas) and Kerry Nettle (NSW) were up for re-election, Brown was re-elected, but Nettle was unsuccessful, becoming the only Australian Greens senator to lose their seat."
321,"Elected at the 2001 federal election on a primary vote of 4.36% in New South Wales with One Nation and micro-party preference flows, she failed to gain re-election in 2007 due to preferences, despite an increase in the New South Wales Green primary vote to 8.43%."
322,"Other Greens Senate candidates were Larissa Waters (Qld), Richard Di Natale (Vic), Scott Ludlam (WA), Sarah Hanson-Young (SA) and Kerrie Tucker (ACT)."
323,Ludlam and Hanson-Young were elected and took up office on 26 August 2008 when all senators elected on 24 November 2007 were sworn in.
324,"This was also the first general election for the Greens in which a lower house seat went ""maverick""."
325,"In the Division of Melbourne, the Greens polled 22.80% of the primary vote, overtaking the Liberals on preferences, finishing on a two-party-preferred figure of 45.29% against Labor."
326,"An extensive campaign was undertaken in the ACT, in an attempt to end coalition control of the Senate immediately after the election, as territory senators take their place at this time as opposed to their state counterparts on the next 1 July."
327,"The ACT elects two seats with terms (in parallel with those of the House of Representatives), so a larger quota than normal is required for election."
328,"Despite a swing of 5.1 points to the Greens, on 21.5%, their best result in any state or territory, the party fell significantly short of the required quota."
329,"At the 2008 Northern Territory election, the Greens ran in six of the 25 seats in the unicameral parliament, averaging 16% of the vote but won no seats."
330,"At the 2008 Western Australian election, the Greens won 11–12 percent of the statewide vote in both the lower and upper houses, with four of 36 seats in the latter, an increase of two."
331,"In the 2008 Australian Capital Territory election, conducted under the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation, the Greens doubled their vote to around 15%, going from one to four seats in the 17-member unicameral parliament, giving them the balance of power."
332,"After almost two weeks of deliberations, the Greens chose to allow Labor to form a minority government."
333,"The Greens held the post of Speaker in the ACT Legislative Assembly, the first for a Green party in Australia."
334,"In November 2008, Senator Christine Milne was elected deputy leader in a ballot contested against Senator Rachel Siewert."
335,"In May 2009, the Greens won their second-ever single-member electorate, with Adele Carles winning the Fremantle by-election for the Western Australian Legislative Assembly."
336,The seat had been held by the Labor Party since 1924.
337,It was the first time the Greens had outpolled the Labor Party on the primary vote in any Labor-held seat.
338,"In December 2009, the Greens received over 30 percent of the primary vote in the federal Higgins by-election in Victoria, in the absence of a Labor candidate."
339,It is the highest primary vote recorded by the Greens in a Liberal-held lower-house seat.
340,"At the 2010 Tasmanian election, the Greens won 21.6 percent of the primary vote amongst the five multi-member electorates, resulting in the Greens winning five of twenty-five seats in the lower house and holding the balance of power."
341,"With Labor and the Liberals winning ten seats each, the Greens backed a Labor minority government."
342,"Tasmanian Greens Leader Nick McKim was appointed to the new Labor-Green cabinet, making him the first Green Minister in Australia."
343,"In the lead-up to the 2010 Australian federal election, the Australian Christian Lobby and the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney criticised Greens policies as ""anti-Christian""."
344,"In an 8 August opinion article for Sydney's ""Sunday Telegraph"" newspaper, Cardinal Archbishop George Pell wrote that the Greens were hostile to the family, opposed to religious schools, had pressured against Catholic management of Calvary Hospital in Canberra and said the party contained Stalinists and a wing who were ""watermelons"" -""green on the outside, red on the inside"" whose policies were ""impractical and expensive, which will not help the poor""."
345,"In response to the article, Senator Bob Brown said Pell was ""bearing false witness"" and that the Greens were in fact, ""much closer to mainstream Christian thinking than Cardinal Pell""."
346,Jesuit human rights lawyer Fr.
347,"Frank Brennan responded in an essay by saying that while some Greens might be anti-Christian, others like Lin Hatfield Dodds ""have given distinguished public service in their churches for decades."
348,"On some policy issues, wrote Brennan, ""the Greens have a more Christian message than the major parties"", while on issues such as abortion, stem-cell research, same-sex marriage and funding for church schools, the party would never be able to ""carry the day given that policy changes in these areas will occur only if they are supported by a majority from both major political parties""."
349,"In the lead up to the 2010 election, Bob Brown opposed the senate pre-selection of high-profile New South Wales Green Lee Rhiannon in favour of environmentalist Cate Faehrmann, saying that the Greens needed ""new blood""."
350,"Rhiannon, a socialist who had also campaigned on gun control, foreign aid, political donations and urban renewal said that there were differing visions for the future of the Greens – one of increased centralisation of party decision making versus a vision she supported of empowering membership."
351,Rhiannon was confirmed as the candidate.
352,"At the 2010 federal election the Greens received a four percent swing to finish with 13 percent of the vote (more than 1.6 million votes) in the Senate, a first for any Australian minor party."
353,The Senate vote throughout the states was between 10 and 20 percent.
354,"The Greens won a seat in each of the six states at the election, again a first for any Australian minor party, bringing the party to a total of nine senators from July 2011, holding the balance of power in the Senate."
355,"The new senators were Lee Rhiannon in New South Wales, Richard Di Natale in Victoria, Larissa Waters in Queensland, Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, Penny Wright in South Australia and Christine Milne in Tasmania."
356,"Incumbents Scott Ludlam in Western Australia, Sarah Hanson-Young in South Australia and Bob Brown in Tasmania were not due for re-election."
357,"The Greens also won their first House of Representatives seat at a general election, the seat of Melbourne with candidate Adam Bandt, who was a crossbencher in the first hung parliament since the 1940 federal election."
358,"Almost two weeks after the election, Bandt and the Greens agreed to support a Gillard Labor minority government on confidence and supply votes."
359,Labor was returned to government with the additional support of three independent crossbenchers.
360,The election resulted in a hung parliament.
361,Six crossbench MPs shared the balance of power.
362,"The Greens signed a formal agreement with the Australian Labor Party involving consultation in relation to policy and support in the House of Representatives in relation to confidence and supply and three of the independents declared their support for Labor on confidence and supply, allowing Gillard and Labor to remain in power with a 76–74 minority government."
363,"In the 2010 Victorian election, the Liberal party directed voters to preference the ALP ahead of the Greens."
364,"The Greens' primary vote increased slightly overall from 10.04% to 10.6% of the overall vote, but the party did not win any lower-house seats."
365,"Federal Greens leader Bob Brown said of the result that it was positive but that: ""The Liberals' preferencing to Labor means that instead of there being three Greens in the new parliament there won't be""."
366,"On 24 February 2011, in a joint press conference of the ""Climate Change Committee"" – comprising the Government, Greens and two independent MPs – Prime Minister Gillard announced a plan to legislate for the introduction of a fixed price to be imposed on ""carbon pollution"" from 1 July 2012 The carbon price would be placed for three to five years before a full emissions trading scheme is implemented, under a blueprint agreed by a multi-party parliamentary committee."
367,"Key issues remained to be negotiated between the Government and the cross-benches, including compensation arrangements for households and businesses, the carbon price level, the emissions reduction target and whether or not to include fuel in the price."
368,The Greens support protecting the welfare of the people of Libya and so supported the United States-led military intervention in Libya.
369,"The view of Deputy leader Christine Milne, that the Greens ""want to make sure that [they] protect civilians wherever [they] can... to ensur[e] that we will save lives..."", is commensurate with this position."
370,"At the Greens NSW State Conference, which was held prior to the New South Wales state election in 2011, a resolution was adopted in support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel."
371,"The move, proposed by Sylvia Hale and backed by Lee Rhiannon, had already been rejected by Leader Bob Brown."
372,"Soon after, however, their motion was backed by the Marrickville Council – resulting in a ""boycott [against] all goods made in Israel and any sporting, academic, government or cultural exchanges""."
373,"Local Labor MP Anthony Albanese called the move ""misguided"", sparking media interest and inciting anger among many Jewish Australians."
374,The move also caused a rift within the Greens.
375,"Following the 2010 election, Bob Brown said that he had conveyed his disapproval of this policy to Rhiannon."
376,"Brown said that the policy was ""a mistake"" made by the NSW branch whereas Rhiannon said it had not been prosecuted hard enough."
377,"Amidst ongoing debate over taxation, industry policy and climate change, Leader Bob Brown began to refer to sections within the Australian media that expressed criticism of Greens' policies or candidates as the ""hate media"", singling out the Murdoch Press in particular."
378,"Outlining his industry and climate policies on ABC's 7:30 Program in May 2011, Bob Brown voiced support for a reduction in subsidies to fossil fuel industries, the implementation of a price on carbon; a higher level of profit tax on the mining industry and a phasing out of Australia's coal export industry, saying: ""The world is going to do that because it is causing massive economic damage down the line through the impact of climate change."
379,"In 2011, the Greens called for the permanent closure of Australia's live export meat industry, following revelations of mistreatment of Australian cattle in some Indonesian abattoirs."
380,On 24 March 2012 Queensland election the total primary vote for The Queensland Greens fell by 0.84% to 7.53%.
381,"On 13 April 2012, Bob Brown announced that he was resigning as federal parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens and that he would leave the Senate in June."
382,Christine Milne was elected unanimously as the new leader by the party.
383,MP Adam Bandt was elected deputy leader.
384,"The ""ease of the Greens leadership transition"" was widely praised, with one commentator noting ""She has survived the transition in leadership with grace and steadfastness of vision"
385,", and Milne set about expanding the party's reach, looking first to regional Australia."
386,Milne took the leadership at a time when the Greens nationally had passed a peak.
387,"In the 18 months between the high water mark of the 2010 Federal Election and Brown's retirement, polls nationally were trending downwards."
388,"This was reflected in a number of setbacks for state and local Greens parties, which some commentators blamed on Brown's absence."
389,"The outcome of 20 October 2012 election in the ACT resulted in a reduction of Greens Legislative Assembly members, from four to one."
390,The Western Australian election was held in March 2013.
391,"For the Legislative Assembly, the total primary vote for the Greens fell by 3.52% to 8.40%."
392,In the Legislative Council the Greens' representation was reduced from four to two members.
393,"Even some impressive results which failed to deliver wins, such as the 2012 Melbourne state by-election, where the Greens received the highest number of first preference votes but did not win the seat as some had expected, were used to attack Milne."
394,"In a 19 February address to the National Press Club in Canberra, Christine Milne announced that the Federal Greens alliance with the Labor Party was ""effectively over""."
395,"In particular, Milne cited a failure by the Gillard Government to redraft the mining tax it had concluded prior to the 2010 Election as evidence that the government had ""walked away"" from its agreement with the Greens."
396,"Nevertheless, Milne promised to continue to guarantee confidence and supply to the Labor Government on the floor of Parliament, so as not to ""advance the interests"" of Opposition Leader Tony Abbott."
397,"Milne was aware that the period in balance of power would be electorally costly for the party, telling members that ""You earn political capital in opposition and you spend it in power."
398,"With that in mind, and following the disappointing state results, Milne and the Australian Greens set as their goal for the 2013 election a clear target of retaining their existing seats and perhaps win one more Senate seat in Victoria, rather than to increase the vote nationally."
399,"Despite a reduction in the vote, maintaining and slightly increasing parliamentary representation is exactly what Milne achieved."
400,Christine Milne resigned as leader of the Australian Greens on 6 May 2015.
401,"Milne was replaced by Victorian senator Richard Di Natale, with Adam Bandt being replaced as deputy leader by Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam at the same time."
402,"Richard Di Natale became leader of the Australian Greens following Christine Milne's resignation, on 6 May 2015."
403,"Under Richard Di Natale, the party has taken a much more pragmatic approach to policy and dealing with government legislation than under previous leaders."
404,"The party voted in support for legislation that saw assets testing for age pensions reduced from $1M down to $800,000."
405,The Greens also negotiated with the government and secured a tax disclosure threshold for big businesses earning more than $200M a year.
406,In November 2016 the Greens voted with the Turnbull government to levy a 15% tax on foreign backpackers on working holiday visas.
407,At the 2013 federal election the House of Representatives (lower house) primary vote was 8.7 percent (−3.1) with the Senate (upper house) primary vote at 8.7 percent (−4.5).
408,"Despite that, as targeted, the Greens representation in the parliament increased."
409,Adam Bandt retained his Melbourne seat with a primary vote of 42.6 percent (+7.0) and a two-candidate preferred vote of 55.3 percent (−0.6).
410,"The Greens won four Senate positions, increasing their Senate representation from nine to ten Senators to take effect from 1 July 2014, to a total of eleven Green members in the Parliament of Australia."
411,"Writing in the Australian Financial Review, Vincent Mahon, a former campaign manager for the Greens, said that while the Greens were able to present positive achievements to the electors relating to education, health, the environment and the promotion of clean energy, the party was unable to attract disenchanted Labor voters."
412,He noted that Green policies relating to carbon pricing and refugees were unpopular with many voters.
413,Christine Milne said that the Greens support of the Labor minority government was a factor in the Greens' lower vote.
414,"Following the federal election, South Australian Greens Senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, who had lost a ballot against Senator Milne for Deputy Leadership and lost again to Adam Bandt, publicly criticised Senator Milne."
415,"In September 2013, it was reported that six senior Greens' staffers had resigned including Chief of Staff, Ben Oquist, who claimed there were, ""fundamental differences of opinion on strategy""."
416,"There have been suggestions that Oquist was behind the unsuccessful attempt to create leadership tensions because he feared moves to ""freeze him out""."
417,"At the 2014 Western Australian Senate election the Greens won in excess of a quota with the primary vote increasing from 9.5 to 15.6 percent, re-electing Scott Ludlam."
418,"Ludlam threw his weight behind Milne's leadership, telling ABC radio on being asked if he had leadership ambitions that ""That's very flattering, but Christine Milne is doing a great job""."
419,"On 17 July 2015, Wright announced that she would be resigning from the Senate due to illness in her family."
420,2016 federal election onward
421,"At the 2016 federal election the House of Representatives (lower house) primary vote increased to 10.23 percent (+1.58) but decreased in the Senate (upper house), with primary vote at 8.65 percent (−0.58)."
422,Adam Bandt was elected to a third term in his Melbourne seat with a primary vote of 43.75 percent (+1.13) and a two-candidate preferred vote of 68.48 percent (+13.21).
423,"Despite a campaign focus on winning additional seats in the lower house, The Greens failed to win any lower house contests."
424,"Their closest seats were Batman, where the Greens won the most first preference votes and turned the once safe Labor seat into a marginal Labor vs Green seat, and Melbourne Ports, where the Greens were fewer than 1000 votes off overtaking Labor, which would have likely (but not certainly) resulted in a Greens victory."
425,"Wills, Higgins, Grayndler and Division of Warringah saw Greens make the two-candidate-preferred result."
426,Deposits were retained in 141 of the 150 seats.
427,"The Greens also lost one Senate position in South Australia, decreasing their Senate representation from ten to nine Senators, to a total of ten Green members in the Parliament of Australia."
428,"The result was seen as disappointing, and caused internal divisions to flare up, with former Federal Leader Bob Brown calling upon Senator Lee Rhiannon to resign, citing the ""need for renewal""."
429,"Tensions within the party reached a flashpoint in late 2016 when a group of Greens members announced their intention to form a faction within the party called ""Left Renewal""."
430,"Their stated aim is to ""end capitalism"" and stop ""global imperialism""."
431,"The faction's existence is supported by Senator Lee Rhiannon and State MP David Shoebridge, however party leader Richard Di Natale has publicly criticised the grouping saying its manifesto was ""ridiculous"" and its members should consider leaving the Greens."
432,"Former leader Bob Brown also attacked the group calling it ""a joke""."
433,In June 2017 Lee Rhiannon was suspended from the Federal Greens party room following an internal dispute over her opposition to the Federal Greens' support for the Turnbull government education funding changes.

435,"On 14 July 2017, Ludlam resigned from the Senate after he found that he had dual Australian-New Zealand citizenship."
436,"The next week on 18 July 2017, his former co-deputy, and Queensland Senator, Larissa Waters resigned, after discovering that she held dual citizenship with Canada, and that had she been born a week later that would not have been the case."

444,"Leading up to the 2019 election, Di Natali stated that, ""Climate change matters more than anything else at this election because it is, quite literally, an existential threat to humanity."

466,This election was described as a 'climate election'.
467,Every election from this point on will be a climate election.
468,"We're breaking record, on record, with extreme weather, drought."
469,And I think the community's only going to become increasingly concerned about the lack of [climate] action.
470,"Following the dramatic increase in votes for the German Greens Party - where their vote increased from 9% in the 2017 German election to 20.5% in the 2019 European elections - Di Natali has argued that, ""there's a real possibility of the [Australian] Greens seeing that big increase - a similar increase to the increase we saw in Germany."

479,"The party would also place a ban on animal-tested cosmetics and ingredients and end caged egg production and sow stalls, instead favouring ethical farming practices."

489,"Bandt stated, ""The UK Parliament has recognised the world is facing an existential climate crisis and that we all need to act urgently."
490,I will seek to move a similar motion to the UK and have a state of climate emergency declared here [too]...
491,"It's time to act as if our house is on fire, because it is..."
492,The Greens are the only party that supports emergency action.
493,"In October 2019, former Liberal Party leader Dr John Hewson supported Adam Bandt's call for a climate emergency declaration, citing that ""climate was an emergency some 30 years ago."
494,He urged the Liberal Party to provide a conscience vote on the issue.
495,"The Greens support the implementation of the Portuguese model when it comes to drug law reform - specifically, the decriminalisation of drugs in favour of treating drug addiction as a health issue rather than merely a law and order issue."
496,"The Greens argue that, ""A harm minimisation approach is the most appropriate way to reduce the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug or substance use, for the individual user and the community"" and that, ""drug policies and programs should be adopted that are evidence-based and subject to continuous evaluation."

507,"Greens leader Richard Di Natale, in a speech delivered to the National Press Club in March 2017, proposed that a discussion be had around the future of work in Australia, arguing that reduced work hours, or a shorter working week, will increase productivity and create new employment opportunities for those wishing to work more hours, while also allowing those wishing to work less the opportunity to do so."
508,"The shortfall in terms of wages earned would be made up through reform in the social welfare system; specifically, by the implementation of a universal basic income (UBI)."

510,"The party also supports winding back and reforming negative gearing, as well as stamp duty, as a way of reducing the cost of housing."

515,Working people need a living wage enshrined in law.
516,The Liberal and Labor tax cuts arms race will further entrench inequality.
517,A wage increase is better than a tax cut.
518,"Instead of continuing to hurdle down the road of becoming a US-style unequal society we need to lift the minimum wage, raise Newstart and invest in universal services."
519,"The Greens acknowledge that inaction on climate change would produce dire economic costs, with evidence suggesting that climate change will negatively impact Australian tourism, a significant economic asset."

521,The party also opposes the casualisation of the workforce and wants to introduce a benchmark of 80% permanent teaching staff throughout public and private VET providers.
522,"The party wants class sizes to be reduced and teachers' wages to reflect their professionalism, expertise and valuable contribution to the development of young minds."

527,"In 2019, the Greens pledged to create 180,000 new jobs in the renewable energy sector, including a renewable energy export industry to replace coal exports."

529,The Greens are the only party with an energy policy consistent with keeping global warming at or below 1.5ºC.
530,"The party opposes the opening of new coal mines, and has campaigned against the Adani Carmichael coal mine using the slogan ""Stop Adani"", as well as the Abbot Point coal terminal."
531,"The party calls for the phasing out, closure and rehabilitation of currently operating coal mines; and the putting in place a transition plan for workers."
532,The party is strongly opposed to coal-seam gas mining (fracking) and regularly participate and have even organised community demonstrations against the practice.
533,"The Greens want to create ""Power Australia"", a not-for-profit, public energy retailer, which would reduce electricity bills by an estimated $200 a year for the average customer."
534,"The Greens support lowering power prices for small businesses by re-regulating electricity prices through the aforementioned Power Australia energy retailer, which would sell cheaper electricity to small businesses and drive down retail prices."
535,"Adam Bandt, Greens spokesperson for energy, has stated:""Small business is bearing the brunt of the old parties' addiction to gas and coal."
536,"The government loves to talk up its small business credentials, but businesses are talking about closing because Angus Taylor [Liberal MP for energy and emissions reduction] doesn't have the guts to get energy prices under control."
537,The Greens will stand up to the big power corporations on behalf of small business.
538,"In addition to offering cheap, clean electricity packages to small businesses, our package will help businesses fuel switch from gas to electricity..."
539,"The Greens will re-establish programs that were working well before Tony Abbott tore them down, like the Clean Technology Innovation Program."
540,"The key to helping small business isn't to abandon them with a small government, neoliberal approach, but for government and industry to work cooperatively to help small businesses embrace the clean energy transition."

542,"The Greens claim to have ""an extensive plan to protect our environment"", including addressing the fact that 1,800 native Australian animal and plant species are currently at risk of extinction."

552,"The Greens argue for democratic reforms to the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank to better promote sustainable trade and development."
553,The party would end Australia's Defence Treaty with the United States unless it can be changed to operate within the Greens' view on Australia's national interest.
554,"Former Greens leader Bob Brown argued that, ""The US is a very great friend of Australia and always will be."
555,But that doesn't mean that we cave in to their demands.
556,"In 1991, the Greens stated their opposition to the Gulf War, and in 2003, opposition to the Iraq War."

589,"A convenor of the ACT Greens party has said when same-sex marriage is limited to, ""two consenting adults [this] discriminates against others in the gay community, including polyamorists""."
590,He accused the Greens of being hypocrites because the logic they use to argue for marriage equality should extend to people who have multiple partners.
591,"However, others have argued that the Greens policy does not constitute discrimination as limiting the number of partners to two within a marriage does not distinguish between any physical, cultural or diverse characteristics an individual possesses."

603,The party believe that all political donations from the gun lobby should be banned.
604,"From 2011-2018, pro-gun groups have donated thousands of dollars to Australian political parties, including Katter's Australia Party ($808,760), the Shooters' Party ($699,834), the Coalition ($82,525), the Liberal Democratic Party ($37,311), the Labor Party ($33,032) and One Nation ($6,203)."

608,"Greens MP Adam Bandt stated:""By winding back unfair tax breaks to big polluters and big corporations, we can invest $19.4 billion into science, research and innovation to set us up for the future."
609,Australia is lagging behind.
610,Commonwealth investment in research and development is at its lowest level in 40 years.
611,The old parties are stuck in the past.
612,"They're addicted to the donations of old, entrenched and polluting industries so they don't have a vision or the ability to usher in the jobs and industries of the future."
613,This plan will put Australia on a path to joining other advanced countries that spend 4% of GDP on research and development.
614,The Australian Greens support a progressive taxation system.
615,The party is concerned about tax avoidance by large corporations.
616,"For example, during the 2016-2017 period, 722 of Australia's largest corporations paid $0 in tax, according to a report by the Australian Taxation Office."
617,"At the 2010 federal election, the party advocated for an increase in the company tax rate to 33% and an increase in the Gillard Government's Mineral Resource Rent Tax; a new top marginal tax rate of 50%; the reintroduction of estate duties; a ""Tobin tax"" on foreign currency transactions; that family trusts be taxed as ""companies""; the introduction of road congestion charges; and elimination of fringe benefit tax concessions for cars."
618,"Despite widespread media reports during 2019 that the party supported a ""death tax"", estate duties were disendorsed and removed from the Australian Greens' policy platform in November 2012."
619,The policy had not been a part of their platform for several years.
620,"Despite being mistruths, the ""death tax"" scare campaign was promoted by several Liberal MPs, including Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Corangamite MP Sarah Henderson, Hughes MP Craig Kelly, and Senator Jane Hume, as well as Pauline Hanson."
621,"The Greens state clearly on their website that, ""We [The Greens] do not have any proposal for an inheritance tax in our election platform."

623,"In 2018, the party also endorsed removal of tax exemptions for religious organisations."
624,"In 2019, the Greens voted against the Liberal government's $158 billion tax cut, arguing that it would disproportionately favour the wealthiest income earners in Australia."
625,"Di Natale accused Labor of becoming ""simply a paler version of the Morrison government"", arguing that ""by voting for $158 billion in revenue cuts that will hurt people doing it tough and line the pockets of millionaires, Anthony Albanese has abandoned the mantle of opposition leader"", and declaring the Greens the ""real opposition""."
626,On Saturday 12 November 2005 at the national conference in Hobart the Australian Greens abandoned their long-standing tradition of having no official leader and approved a process whereby a parliamentary leader could be elected by the Greens Parliamentary Party Room.
627,"On Monday 28 November 2005, Bob Brown – who had long been regarded as ""de facto"" leader by many inside the party, and most people outside the party – was elected unopposed as the Parliamentary Party Leader."
628,The current leadership team is Richard Di Natale as leader and Adam Bandt and Larissa Waters serving as co-deputy leaders.
629,"The Australian Greens, like all Australian political parties, is federally organised with separately registered state parties signing up to a national constitution, yet retaining considerable policy-making and organisational autonomy from the centre."

631,"There is also a Public Officer, a Party Agent and a Registered Officer."
632,The National Council arrives at decisions by consensus.
633,All policies originating from this structure are subject to ratification by the members of the Australian Greens at National Conference.
634,"The various Australian states and territories have different electoral systems, all of which allow the Greens to gain representation."
635,"In New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, the Greens hold seats in the Legislative Councils (upper houses), which are elected by proportional representation."
636,"The Greens also hold two seats in the unicameral Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly since the 2016 election, up from one after the 2012 election."
637,"In Queensland and the Northern Territory, their unicameral parliaments have made it difficult for the Greens to gain representation."
638,The Australian Greens are a federation consisting of eight parties from each state and territory:
639,"The Greens' most important area of state political activity has been in Tasmania, which is the only state where the lower house of the state parliament is elected by proportional representation."
640,"In Tasmania, the Greens have been represented in the House of Assembly from 1983, initially as Green Independents, and from the early 1990s as an established party."
641,"At the 1989 state election, the Liberal Party won 17 seats to Labor's 13 and the Greens' 5."
642,The Greens agreed to support a minority Labor government in exchange for a number of policy commitments.
643,"In 1992 the agreement broke down over the issue of employment in the forestry industry, and the premier, Michael Field, called an early state election which the Liberals won."
644,"Later, Labor and the Liberals combined to reduce the size of the Assembly from 35 to 25, thus raising the quota for election."
645,"At the 1998 election the Greens won only one seat, despite their vote only falling slightly, mainly due to the new electoral system."
646,They recovered in the 2002 election when they won four seats.
647,All four seats were retained in the 2006 election.
648,"After gaining 5 seats in the 2010 election, in April 2010 Nick McKim became the first Green Minister in Australia."
649,"In the 2011 New South Wales election, the Greens claimed their first lower-house seat in the district of Balmain."
650,"In the 2014 Victorian election, they won two lower-house seats, those of Melbourne and Prahran."
651,"Three Greens have become ministers at the state/territory level: Nick McKim and Cassy O'Connor in Tasmania until 2014, and Shane Rattenbury in the ACT to the present."
652,"A variety of working groups have been established by the National Council, which are directly accessible to all Greens members."
653,"Working groups perform an advisory function by developing policy, reviewing or developing the party structure, or by performing other tasks assigned by the National Council."
654,The Australian Young Greens are a federation of Young Greens groups from each Australian state and territory.
655,Together they form the Youth Wing of the Australian Greens
656,A national Sexuality and Gender Identity Working Group existed from 2008-2012.
657,It was concerned with advancing the party's position on LGBTIQ rights.
658,The last National Conference agreed to start planning to revive the group.
659,"There are LGBTIQ working groups in some state and territory parties, including:"
660,"Greens MPs are each assigned their own portfolios, or specific areas of responsibility."
661,"All portfolios are decided by the party and may differ in title from the Government's portfolio priorities - for example, the Greens have formed a 'Gun Control' portfolio, of which there is no equivalent in the Government."
662,"Portfolios are divided into five major categories according to the Greens: ""An equal society"", ""world-class essential services"", ""climate and the environment"", ""the green economy"", and ""a confident Australia""."
663,"As of 2019, Greens MPs hold the following portfolios:"
664,"The Greens do not have formal links to environmental organisations commonly labelled by the media as ""green groups"" such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, The Wilderness Society and Greenpeace, all of whom claim to be non-partisan."
665,"However, it is common for the media to report the activities of such groups and those of The Greens under the general category of ""greens""."
666,"During elections, there is sometimes competition between The Greens and one or more of these groups negotiating ""greens preferences"" with other parties."
667,"The Greens preference negotiation objectives are to attempt to get Greens senators elected, and to get policy outcomes on issues like Tasmanian forests, though these objectives may be to a greater or lesser extent in conflict and the Greens more often direct preferences to Labor than the Liberals, but it is claimed that this did not affect federal election outcomes in 2001 and 2004."
668,"The Greens were in a formal alliance with the Australian Labor Party in the Tasmanian Parliament under the Bartlett and Giddings governments between 2010 and 2014, and signed a formal agreement with the minority Gillard Labor Government in the Federal Australian Parliament in 2010."
669,"Milne declared this agreement ""effectively over"" in February 2013, but said that the Greens would continue to support Labor in the Parliament."
670,Generally the Greens preference Labor ahead of the Coalition at elections.
671,Many Labor supporters and trade unionists see the Greens' policies as destructive of employment in industries like mining and forestry.
672,The forestry industry has been a particular target of environmental campaigns and the Forestry Division of the CFMEU have actively campaigned against the Greens.
673,Left-wing trade unionists and some members of Labor's Left faction sympathise with the Greens' social policies and often identify more readily with the Greens than with the Labor Right.
674,"Some unionists, such as NTEU and AMWU members have run for State or Federal parliament for the Greens."
675,"South Australian Labor MP, Kris Hanna, defected to the Australian Greens in 2003 (before leaving the Greens in 2006, and being re-elected as an independent in the 2006 South Australian election)."
676,"In 2008, Queensland Labor MP Ronan Lee defected to the Greens, becoming the first-ever Greens MP in the unicameral Queensland parliament."
677,"He said he made the decision after the Queensland government had ""failed to act"" against climate change."
678,"In 2015, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia (ETU) invited federal Greens MP Adam Bandt as a speaker at the ETU National Officers' Conference in Adelaide on account of their shared opposition to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which was approved by both the ALP and LNP ."
679,"Adam Bandt also spoke of the importance of ""transition funding"" to support workers and communities who would be affected by a transition from coal-fired power to renewable energy sources."
680,"The Greens also announced Jim Casey, the NSW state secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees Union, as the candidate for the 2016 federal election in Grayndler."
681,"However, these Green sympathies are not universal within Labor's Left and the two groups often find themselves competing in elections, making the Greens' growing popularity a threat to Labor."
682,"In 2002, Labor front bencher and prominent Left member Lindsay Tanner wrote ""The emergence of the Greens... is already hurting the ALP's ability to attract new members amongst young people."
683,"During the 2004 campaign, Tanner's own seat of Melbourne in Victoria was thought to be under serious threat by the Greens and he described Greens policies as ""mad""."
684,"In the end, Tanner held the seat comfortably on primary votes (51.78%, +4.35-point swing)."
685,He did not stand for election at the 2010 election and his seat was won by the Greens.
686,"In the 2006 Victorian state election, there was increased bitterness between Labor and the Greens."
687,"Labor direct-mailed a letter from Peter Garrett to voters in its threatened inner-Melbourne seats claiming that the Greens were preferencing the Liberal Party, in spite of Greens preferences being either for Labor or being open."
688,"Following the election, The Age's Paul Austin wrote ""Labor's campaign manager, state secretary Stephen Newnham, reckons he knows why the Greens' support fell away in the last days of the campaign."
689,"He has told cabinet and caucus members it was because of Labor's loud assertions that the Greens had done a secret preferences deal with the Liberals""."
690,"In April 2007, ""The Age"" reported that the Victorian Greens had published a poem titled ""The Battle of Jeff's Shed"", by Mike Puleston, describing ALP officials and volunteers who scrutinised vote counting after the state election as ""the Labor Panzers and their hardened SS troops – SS stood for Sturm Scrutineers""."
691,"The poem described the final vote count at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre, which finished about 4 am on 14 December and resulted in the election of three Greens MLCs."
692,"Labor directed preferences in the upper house to the DLP above the Greens, which resulted in their preferences indirectly electing Peter Kavanagh from DLP in Western Victoria Region."
693,"Prior to the 2010 Federal Election, the Electrical Trades Union's Victorian branch donated $325,000 to the Greens' Victorian campaign – the largest political donation ever directed to the Party up to that time."
694,"In March 2011, division emerged within the Labor Party over Prime Minister Gillard's initial support for a Greens proposal to remove the commonwealth veto over Territory legislation."
695,"Joe de Bruyn, head of the Shop, Distributors and Allied Employees Association, said ""Everybody in the federal parliament knows that this is simply a way of letting the territories into euthanasia or whatever else they want to do""."
696,Anti-euthanasia Labor senators called on Gillard to overturn Labor's support for the Greens plan and press reports said some Labor senators had complained that the issue had not been discussed in Cabinet.
697,Prime Minister Gillard said that no caucus members had raised concerns with her over the influence of the Greens over Labor policy.
698,"Amidst suggestions that Labor was ""too close"" to the Greens, Prime Minister Gillard said in March: ""The Greens are not a party of government and have no tradition of striking the balance required to deliver major reform""."
699,Relations between the Greens and the Liberal-National Coalition are generally poor and the Greens usually direct voters to preference the Labor Party ahead of the Liberals or Nationals in Australian elections.
700,"The Coalition has however directed strategic preferences to the Greens over Labor in the past, as in the Division of Melbourne, where Adam Bandt was elected at the 2010 Australian federal election with Liberal Preferences."
701,"In addition, the Tasmanian Liberal Party under Tony Rundle managed to form a minority government through an informal alliance with the Tasmanian Greens between 1996 and 1998, enacting some progressive reforms in favour of forest conservation and LGBT rights during its term."
702,"At the 2010 Victorian State Election, the Liberals put their preference for the Greens below the Labor Party."
703,"During the 2004 federal election the Australian Greens were branded as ""environmental extremists"" and ""fascists"" by some members of the Liberal-National Coalition Government."
704,"John Anderson described the Greens as 'watermelons', being ""green on the outside and red on the inside""."
705,"John Howard, while Australian Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, stated that ""The Greens are not just about the environment."
706,"They have a whole lot of other very, very kooky policies in relation to things like drugs and all of that sort of stuff""."
707,Former Federal Conservation Minister Eric Abetz criticised former Australian Greens senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle for spending most of their time on non-environmental issues.
708,"In 2011, Liberal Shadow Cabinet frontbencher Kevin Andrews published a critique of the Greens policy agenda for Quadrant Magazine in which he wrote that the Greens' ""objective involves a radical transformation of the culture that underpins Western civilisation"" and that their agenda would threaten the ""Judeo-Christian/Enlightenment synthesis that upholds the individual"" as well as ""the economic system that has resulted in the creation of wealth and prosperity for the most people in human history."
709,"In December 2013, Liberal Party Treasurer Joe Hockey secured a deal with the Greens to remove the debt ceiling in response to debt approaching the current limit of $300b, despite opposition from the Labor Party."
710,"In December 2015, the Greens struck a deal with the Coalition Government, passing a law requiring multinational private companies with a turnover over $200 million to disclose their tax arrangements and also making it mandatory for multinational companies with a ""global"" turnover of $1 billion or more to have to prepare ""general purpose"" financial statements, which disclose greater tax details than previously occurred in Australia."
711,"Once more the following year the Coalition Government and the Greens agreed on a permanent 15% tax rate for backpackers, in exchange for a $100 million funding boost to environmental stewardship not-for-profit Landcare."
712,"In a similar vein to the Family First television advertisements in 2004, Country Alliance also ran television advertisements in the lead up to the 2006 Victorian state election claiming that the Greens policies were ""extreme""."
713,"The Greens have voiced opposition and even organised protests against the One Nation Party (an anti-immigration, economically protectionist Party which enjoyed significant publicity in the 1998 federal election)."
714,"The Greens generally draw support from younger, wealthier voters with higher than average educational attainment."
715,"The electorates that delivered the Greens' best lower house results at the 2016 election were wealthy metropolitan seats such as Melbourne, Higgins and Melbourne Ports."
716,The Greens absorbed much of the Democrats support base following its downfall as the third party in Australia and many of the social and environmental policies and issues the Democrats advocated for have been taken up by the Greens.
717,"Much like the Democrats, the Greens have a higher proportion of supporters who are university educated, under 40, who identify as professionals in their field (teachers, graphic designers, engineers, etc."
718,as well as small business owners) and who earn above the national average wage.
719,A study conducted by the Roy Morgan Institute in 2013 found that those classified as professionals in their field are 50% more likely to vote Greens than any other party.
720,The top 10 professions to vote Greens in 2013 included:
721,"There is a growing support for the Greens in some regional and rural areas, particularly in the northern coastal regions of New South Wales and the Surf Coast region of Victoria, around environmental and sustainability issues due to the Greens' environmental principles, particularly their opposition to coal-seam gas mining."
722,"However, by and large, Greens support in the most scarcely populated rural areas tends to be lower than average."
723,"According to the ABC's Vote Compass, 63% of Greens voters rated the environment as the most important issue at the 2019 federal election."
724,"The environment was also ranked as the most important issue overall in 2019, including all other voters."
725,"Senators Vallentine, Chamarette and Margetts were all elected as Greens (WA) senators and served their terms before the Greens WA affiliated to the Australian Greens, meaning that they were not considered to be Australian Greens senators at the time."

728,Note that the Greens have never had any representation in the Northern Territory.
729,"For the 2015-2016 financial year, the top ten disclosed donors to the Greens Party were: Graeme Wood (businessman) ($600,000), Duncan Turpie ($400,000), Electrical Trades Union of Australia ($320,000), Louise Crossley ($138,000), Anna Hackett ($100,000), Pater Investments ($100,000), Ruth Greble ($35,000), Minax Uriel Ptd Ltd ($35,000) and Chilla Bulbeck ($32,000)."
730,"Since 2017, the Australian Greens have implemented real-time disclosure of donations to them of over $1,000, in an effort to ""clean up politics""."
731,"In ecology, primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from atmospheric or aqueous carbon dioxide."
732,"It principally occurs through the process of photosynthesis, which uses light as its source of energy, but it also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy."
733,Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production.
734,"The organisms responsible for primary production are known as ""primary producers"" or autotrophs, and form the base of the food chain."
735,"In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly plants, while in aquatic ecoregions algae predominate in this role."
736,"Ecologists distinguish primary production as either ""net"" or ""gross"", the former accounting for losses to processes such as cellular respiration, the latter not."
737,Primary production is the production of chemical energy in organic compounds by living organisms.
738,The main source of this energy is sunlight but a minute fraction of primary production is driven by lithotrophic organisms using the chemical energy of inorganic molecules.
739,"Regardless of its source, this energy is used to synthesize complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO) and water (HO)."
740,The following two equations are simplified representations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) chemosynthesis (bottom):
741,"In both cases, the end point is a polymer of reduced carbohydrate, (CHO), typically molecules such as glucose or other sugars."
742,"These relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules, including proteins, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, or be respired to perform work."
743,"Consumption of primary producers by heterotrophic organisms, such as animals, then transfers these organic molecules (and the energy stored within them) up the food web, fueling all of the Earth's living systems."
744,"Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of chemical energy, typically expressed as carbon biomass, that primary producers create in a given length of time."
745,"Some fraction of this fixed energy is used by primary producers for cellular respiration and maintenance of existing tissues (i.e., ""growth respiration"" and ""maintenance respiration"")."
746,"The remaining fixed energy (i.e., mass of photosynthate) is referred to as net primary production (NPP)."
747,Net primary production is the rate at which all the autotrophs in an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy.
748,"As noted, it is equal to the difference between the rate at which the plants in an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy (GPP) and the rate at which they use some of that energy during respiration."
749,Net primary production is available to be directed toward growth and reproduction of primary producers.
750,As such it is available for consumption by herbivores.
751,Both gross and net primary production are typically expressed in units of mass per unit area per unit time interval.
752,"In terrestrial ecosystems, mass of carbon per unit area per year (g C m yr) is most often used as the unit of measurement."
753,"Note that a distinction is sometimes drawn between ""production"" and ""productivity"", with the former the quantity of material produced (g C m), the latter the rate at which it is produced (g C m yr), but these terms are more typically used interchangeably."
754,"On the land, almost all primary production is now performed by vascular plants, with a small fraction coming from algae and non-vascular plants such as mosses and liverworts."
755,"Before the evolution of vascular plants, non-vascular plants likely played a more significant role."
756,"Primary production on land is a function of many factors, but principally local hydrology and temperature (the latter covaries to an extent with light, specifically photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the source of energy for photosynthesis)."
757,"While plants cover much of the Earth's surface, they are strongly curtailed wherever temperatures are too extreme or where necessary plant resources (principally water and PAR) are limiting, such as deserts or polar regions."
758,"Water is ""consumed"" in plants by the processes of photosynthesis (see above) and transpiration."
759,The latter process (which is responsible for about 90% of water use) is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants.
760,"Transpiration allows plants to transport water and mineral nutrients from the soil to growth regions, and also cools the plant."
761,"Diffusion of water vapour out of a leaf, the force that drives transpiration, is regulated by structures known as stomata."
762,"These structure also regulate the diffusion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the leaf, such that decreasing water loss (by partially closing stomata) also decreases carbon dioxide gain."
763,"Certain plants use alternative forms of photosynthesis, called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C4."
764,These employ physiological and anatomical adaptations to increase water-use efficiency and allow increased primary production to take place under conditions that would normally limit carbon fixation by C3 plants (the majority of plant species).
765,"In a reversal of the pattern on land, in the oceans, almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae, with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups."
766,"Algae encompass a diverse range of organisms, ranging from single floating cells to attached seaweeds."
767,They include photoautotrophs from a variety of groups.
768,"Eubacteria are important photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems, and while some archaea are phototrophic, none are known to utilise oxygen-evolving photosynthesis."
769,"A number of eukaryotes are significant contributors to primary production in the ocean, including green algae, brown algae and red algae, and a diverse group of unicellular groups."
770,Vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses.
771,"Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the majority of primary production in the ocean is performed by free-living microscopic organisms called phytoplankton."
772,"Larger autotrophs, such as the seagrasses and macroalgae (seaweeds) are generally confined to the littoral zone and adjacent shallow waters, where they can attach to the underlying substrate but still be within the photic zone."
773,"There are exceptions, such as ""Sargassum"", but the vast majority of free-floating production takes place within microscopic organisms."
774,The factors limiting primary production in the ocean are also very different from those on land.
775,"The availability of water, obviously, is not an issue (though its salinity can be)."
776,"Similarly, temperature, while affecting metabolic rates (see Q), ranges less widely in the ocean than on land because the heat capacity of seawater buffers temperature changes, and the formation of sea ice insulates it at lower temperatures."
777,"However, the availability of light, the source of energy for photosynthesis, and mineral nutrients, the building blocks for new growth, play crucial roles in regulating primary production in the ocean."
778,Available Earth System Models suggest that ongoing ocean bio-geochemical changes could trigger reductions in ocean NPP between 3% and 10% of current values depending on the emissions scenario.
779,The sunlit zone of the ocean is called the photic zone (or euphotic zone).
780,This is a relatively thin layer (10–100 m) near the ocean's surface where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur.
781,"For practical purposes, the thickness of the photic zone is typically defined by the depth at which light reaches 1% of its surface value."
782,"Light is attenuated down the water column by its absorption or scattering by the water itself, and by dissolved or particulate material within it (including phytoplankton)."
783,Net photosynthesis in the water column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer.
784,Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean's surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer).
785,"The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it."
786,"The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being much deeper than the photic zone."
787,"When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur."
788,The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth.
789,"As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth."
790,Both the magnitude of wind mixing and the availability of light at the ocean's surface are affected across a range of space- and time-scales.
791,"The most characteristic of these is the seasonal cycle (caused by the consequences of the Earth's axial tilt), although wind magnitudes additionally have strong spatial components."
792,"Consequently, primary production in temperate regions such as the North Atlantic is highly seasonal, varying with both incident light at the water's surface (reduced in winter) and the degree of mixing (increased in winter)."
793,"In tropical regions, such as the gyres in the middle of the major basins, light may only vary slightly across the year, and mixing may only occur episodically, such as during large storms or hurricanes."
794,Mixing also plays an important role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients.
795,"Inorganic nutrients, such as nitrate, phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery."
796,"Because of gravitational sinking of particulate material (such as plankton, dead or fecal material), nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone, and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water."
797,"This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water."
798,"Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light)."
799,"However, as long as the photic zone is deep enough, primary production may continue below the mixed layer where light-limited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant."
800,Another factor relatively recently discovered to play a significant role in oceanic primary production is the micronutrient iron.
801,This is used as a cofactor in enzymes involved in processes such as nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation.
802,"A major source of iron to the oceans is dust from the Earth's deserts, picked up and delivered by the wind as aeolian dust."
803,"In regions of the ocean that are distant from deserts or that are not reached by dust-carrying winds (for example, the Southern and North Pacific oceans), the lack of iron can severely limit the amount of primary production that can occur."
804,"These areas are sometimes known as HNLC (High-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll) regions, because the scarcity of iron both limits phytoplankton growth and leaves a surplus of other nutrients."
805,Some scientists have suggested introducing iron to these areas as a means of increasing primary productivity and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
806,"The methods for measurement of primary production vary depending on whether gross vs net production is the desired measure, and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus."
807,"Gross production is almost always harder to measure than net, because of respiration, which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production (i.e."
808,sugars) before they can be accurately measured.
809,"Also, terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to below-ground organs and tissues, where it is logistically difficult to measure."
810,Shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem.
811,Scale also greatly affects measurement techniques.
812,"The rate of carbon assimilation in plant tissues, organs, whole plants, or plankton samples can be quantified by biochemically based techniques, but these techniques are decidedly inappropriate for large scale terrestrial field situations."
813,"There, net primary production is almost always the desired variable, and estimation techniques involve various methods of estimating dry-weight biomass changes over time."
814,"Biomass estimates are often converted to an energy measure, such as kilocalories, by an empirically determined conversion factor."
815,"In terrestrial ecosystems, researchers generally measure net primary production (NPP)."
816,"Although its definition is straightforward, field measurements used to estimate productivity vary according to investigator and biome."
817,"Field estimates rarely account for below ground productivity, herbivory, turnover, litterfall, volatile organic compounds, root exudates, and allocation to symbiotic microorganisms."
818,Biomass based NPP estimates result in underestimation of NPP due to incomplete accounting of these components.
819,"However, many field measurements correlate well to NPP."
820,There are a number of comprehensive reviews of the field methods used to estimate NPP.
821,"Estimates of ecosystem respiration, the total carbon dioxide produced by the ecosystem, can also be made with gas flux measurements."
822,"The major unaccounted pool is belowground productivity, especially production and turnover of roots."
823,Belowground components of NPP are difficult to measure.
824,BNPP (below-ground NPP) is often estimated based on a ratio of ANPP:BNPP (above-ground NPP:below-ground NPP) rather than direct measurements.
825,Gross primary production can be estimated from measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide made by the eddy covariance technique.
826,"During night, this technique measures all components of ecosystem respiration."
827,This respiration is scaled to day-time values and further subtracted from NEE.
828,"Most frequently, peak standing biomass is assumed to measure NPP."
829,"In systems with persistent standing litter, live biomass is commonly reported."
830,Measures of peak biomass are more reliable if the system is predominantly annuals.
831,"However, perennial measurements could be reliable if there were a synchronous phenology driven by a strong seasonal climate."
832,These methods may underestimate ANPP in grasslands by as much as 2 (temperate) to 4 (tropical) fold.
833,"Repeated measures of standing live and dead biomass provide more accurate estimates of all grasslands, particularly those with large turnover, rapid decomposition, and interspecific variation in timing of peak biomass."
834,Wetland productivity (marshes and fens) is similarly measured.
835,"In Europe, annual mowing makes the annual biomass increment of wetlands evident."
836,Methods used to measure forest productivity are more diverse than those of grasslands.
837,Biomass increment based on stand specific allometry plus litterfall is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of above-ground net primary production (ANPP).
838,"Field measurements used as a proxy for ANPP include annual litterfall, diameter or basal area increment (DBH or BAI), and volume increment."
839,"In aquatic systems, primary production is typically measured using one of six main techniques:"
840,The technique developed by Gaarder and Gran uses variations in the concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production.
841,"Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and stoppered."
842,The first is analysed immediately and used to determine the initial oxygen concentration; usually this is done by performing a Winkler titration.
843,"The other two vessels are incubated, one each in under light and darkened."
844,"After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured."
845,"As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration."
846,"The light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration, so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e."
847,oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration).
848,Gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel.
849,"The technique of using C incorporation (added as labelled NaCO) to infer primary production is most commonly used today because it is sensitive, and can be used in all ocean environments."
850,"As C is radioactive (via beta decay), it is relatively straightforward to measure its incorporation in organic material using devices such as scintillation counters."
851,"Depending upon the incubation time chosen, net or gross primary production can be estimated."
852,"Gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times (1 hour or less), since the loss of incorporated C (by respiration and organic material excretion / exudation) will be more limited."
853,Net primary production is the fraction of gross production remaining after these loss processes have consumed some of the fixed carbon.
854,"Loss processes can range between 10-60% of incorporated C according to the incubation period, ambient environmental conditions (especially temperature) and the experimental species used."
855,"Aside from those caused by the physiology of the experimental subject itself, potential losses due to the activity of consumers also need to be considered."
856,"This is particularly true in experiments making use of natural assemblages of microscopic autotrophs, where it is not possible to isolate them from their consumers."
857,The methods based on stable isotopes and O/Ar ratios have the advantage of providing estimates of respiration rates in the light without the need of incubations in the dark.
858,"Among them, the method of the triple oxygen isotopes and O/Ar have the additional advantage of not needing incubations in closed containers and O/Ar can even be measured continuously at sea using equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS) or a membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS)."
859,"However, if results relevant to the carbon cycle are desired, it is probably better to rely on methods based on carbon (and not oxygen) isotopes."
860,"It is important to notice that the method based on carbon stable isotopes is not simply an adaptation of the classic C method, but an entirely different approach that does not suffer from the problem of lack of account of carbon recycling during photosynthesis."
861,"As primary production in the biosphere is an important part of the carbon cycle, estimating it at the global scale is important in Earth system science."
862,"However, quantifying primary production at this scale is difficult because of the range of habitats on Earth, and because of the impact of weather events (availability of sunlight, water) on its variability."
863,"Using satellite-derived estimates of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for terrestrial habitats and sea-surface chlorophyll for the oceans, it is estimated that the total (photoautotrophic) primary production for the Earth was 104.9 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr; equivalent to the non-SI Gt C yr)."
864,"Of this, 56.4 Pg C yr (53.8%), was the product of terrestrial organisms, while the remaining 48.5 Pg C yr, was accounted for by oceanic production."
865,"Scaling ecosystem-level GPP estimations based on eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (see above) to regional and global values using spatial details of different predictor variables, such as climate variables and remotely sensed fAPAR or LAI led to a terrestrial gross primary production of 123±8 Gt carbon (NOT carbon dioxide) per year during 1998-2005"
866,"In areal terms, it was estimated that land production was approximately 426 g C m yr (excluding areas with permanent ice cover), while that for the oceans was 140 g C m yr. Another significant difference between the land and the oceans lies in their standing stocks - while accounting for almost half of total production, oceanic autotrophs only account for about 0.2% of the total biomass."
867,Primary productivity can be estimated by a variety of proxies.
868,"One that has particular relevance to the geological record is Barium, whose concentration in marine sediments rises in line with primary productivity at the surface."
869,"Human societies are part of the Earth's NPP cycle, but exert a disproportionate influence in it."
870,"In 1996, Josep Garí designed a new indicator of sustainable development based precisely on the estimation of the human appropriation of NPP: he coined it ""HANPP"" (Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production) and introduced it at the inaugural conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics."
871,HANPP has since been further developed and widely applied in research on ecological economics as well as in policy analysis for sustainability.
872,HANPP represents a proxy of the human impact on Nature and can be applied to different geographical scales and also globally.
873,"The extensive degree of human use of the Planet's resources, mostly via land use, results in various levels of impact on ""actual NPP"" (NPP)."
874,"Although in some regions, such as the Nile valley, irrigation has resulted in a considerable increase in primary production, in most of the Planet there is a notable trend of ""NPP reduction due to land changes"" (ΔNPP) of 9.6% across global land-mass."
875,"In addition to this, end consumption by people raises the total HANPP to 23.8% of ""potential vegetation"" (NPP)."
876,"It is estimated that, in 2000, 34% of the Earth's ice-free land area (12% cropland; 22% pasture) was devoted to human agriculture."
877,"This disproportionate amount reduces the energy available to other species, having a marked impact on biodiversity, flows of carbon, water and energy, and ecosystem services, and scientists have questioned how large this fraction can be before these services begin to break down."
878,"Reductions in NPP are also expected in the ocean as a result of ongoing climate change, potentially impacting marine ecosystems and goods and services that the oceans provide"
879,"A wind turbine, or alternatively referred to as a wind energy converter, is a device that converts the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy."
880,Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis.
881,The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs.
882,Larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid.
883,"Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, are becoming an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels."
884,"One assessment claimed that, , wind had the ""lowest relative greenhouse gas emissions, the least water consumption demands and... the most favourable social impacts"" compared to photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal and gas."
885,The windwheel of Hero of Alexandria (10 AD – 70 AD) marks one of the first recorded instances of wind powering a machine in history.
886,"However, the first known practical wind power plants were built in Sistan, an Eastern province of Persia (now Iran), from the 7th century."
887,"These ""Panemone"" were vertical axle windmills, which had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades."
888,"Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries."
889,Wind power first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages.
890,The first historical records of their use in England date to the 11th or 12th centuries and there are reports of German crusaders taking their windmill-making skills to Syria around 1190.
891,"By the 14th century, Dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the Rhine delta."
892,Advanced wind turbines were described by Croatian inventor Fausto Veranzio.
893,In his book Machinae Novae (1595) he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or V-shaped blades.
894,"The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland."
895,"Some months later American inventor Charles F. Brush was able to build the first automatically operated wind turbine after consulting local University professors and colleagues Jacob S. Gibbs and Brinsley Coleberd and successfully getting the blueprints peer-reviewed for electricity production in Cleveland, Ohio."
896,"Although Blyth's turbine was considered uneconomical in the United Kingdom, electricity generation by wind turbines was more cost effective in countries with widely scattered populations."
897,"In Denmark by 1900, there were about 2500 windmills for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills, producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW."
898,The largest machines were on towers with four-bladed diameter rotors.
899,"By 1908, there were 72 wind-driven electric generators operating in the United States from 5 kW to 25 kW."
900,"Around the time of World War I, American windmill makers were producing 100,000 farm windmills each year, mostly for water-pumping."
901,"By the 1930s, wind generators for electricity were common on farms, mostly in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed."
902,"In this period, high-tensile steel was cheap, and the generators were placed atop prefabricated open steel lattice towers."
903,"A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis wind generators was in service at Yalta, USSR in 1931."
904,"This was a 100 kW generator on a tower, connected to the local 6.3 kV distribution system."
905,"It was reported to have an annual capacity factor of 32 percent, not much different from current wind machines."
906,"In the autumn of 1941, the first megawatt-class wind turbine was synchronized to a utility grid in Vermont."
907,"The Smith–Putnam wind turbine only ran for 1,100 hours before suffering a critical failure."
908,"The unit was not repaired, because of a shortage of materials during the war."
909,The first utility grid-connected wind turbine to operate in the UK was built by John Brown & Company in 1951 in the Orkney Islands.
910,"Despite these diverse developments, developments in fossil fuel systems almost entirely eliminated any wind turbine systems larger than supermicro size."
911,"In the early 1970s, however, anti-nuclear protests in Denmark spurred artisan mechanics to develop microturbines of 22 kW."
912,Organizing owners into associations and co-operatives lead to the lobbying of the government and utilities and provided incentives for larger turbines throughout the 1980s and later.
913,"Local activists in Germany, nascent turbine manufacturers in Spain, and large investors in the United States in the early 1990s then lobbied for policies that stimulated the industry in those countries."
914,"It has been argued that expanding use of wind power will lead to increasing geopolitical competition over critical materials for wind turbines such as rare earth elements neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium."
915,But this perspective has been criticised for failing to recognise that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production of these minerals.
916,Wind Power Density (WPD) is a quantitative measure of wind energy available at any location.
917,"It is the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine, and is calculated for different heights above ground."
918,Calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density.
919,"Wind turbines are classified by the wind speed they are designed for, from class I to class III, with A to C referring to the turbulence intensity of the wind."
920,Conservation of mass requires that the amount of air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal.
921,"Accordingly, Betz's law gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine."
922,The maximum theoretical power output of a wind machine is thus 16/27 times the kinetic energy of the air passing through the effective disk area of the machine.
923,"If the effective area of the disk is A, and the wind velocity v, the maximum theoretical power output P is:"
924,"where ""ρ"" is the air density."
925,Wind-to-rotor efficiency (including rotor blade friction and drag) are among the factors affecting the final price of wind power.
926,"Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine."
927,"To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency."
928,"In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines delivered 75% to 80% of the Betz limit of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed."
929,"Efficiency can decrease slightly over time, one of the main reasons being dust and insect carcasses on the blades which alters the aerodynamic profile and essentially reduces the lift to drag ratio of the airfoil."
930,"Analysis of 3128 wind turbines older than 10 years in Denmark showed that half of the turbines had no decrease, while the other half saw a production decrease of 1.2% per year."
931,"Ice accretion on turbine blades has also been found to greatly reduce the efficiency of wind turbines, which is a common challenge in cold climates where in-cloud icing and freezing rain events occur."
932,Vertical turbine designs have much lower efficiency than standard horizontal designs.
933,"In general, more stable and constant weather conditions (most notably wind speed) result in an average of 15% greater efficiency than that of a wind turbine in unstable weather conditions, thus allowing up to a 7% increase in wind speed under stable conditions."
934,This is due to a faster recovery wake and greater flow entrainment that occur in conditions of higher atmospheric stability.
935,"However, wind turbine wakes have been found to recover faster under unstable atmospheric conditions as opposed to a stable environment."
936,Different materials have been found to have varying effects on the efficiency of wind turbines.
937,"In an Ege University experiment, three wind turbines (Each with three blades with diameters of one meter) were constructed with blades made of different materials: A glass and glass/carbon epoxy, glass/carbon, and glass/polyester."
938,"When tested, the results showed that the materials with higher overall masses had a greater friction moment and thus a lower power coefficient."
939,"Wind turbines can rotate about either a horizontal or a vertical axis, the former being both older and more common."
940,"They can also include blades, or be bladeless."
941,Vertical designs produce less power and are less common.
942,Large three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) with the blades upwind of the tower produce the overwhelming majority of wind power in the world today.
943,"These turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower, and must be pointed into the wind."
944,"Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a yaw system."
945,"Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator."
946,Some turbines use a different type of generator suited to slower rotational speed input.
947,"These don't need a gearbox and are called direct-drive, meaning they couple the rotor directly to the generator with no gearbox in between."
948,"While permanent magnet direct-drive generators can be more costly due to the rare earth materials required, these gearless turbines are sometimes preferred over gearbox generators because they ""eliminate the gear-speed increaser, which is susceptible to significant accumulated fatigue torque loading, related reliability issues, and maintenance costs."
949,"There is also the pseudo direct drive mechanism, which has some advantages over the permanent magnet direct drive mechanism."
950,Most horizontal axis turbines have their rotors upwind of the supporting tower.
951,"Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind."
952,"In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend, which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance."
953,"Despite these advantages, upwind designs are preferred, because the change in loading from the wind as each blade passes behind the supporting tower can cause damage to the turbine."
954,Turbines used in wind farms for commercial production of electric power are usually three-bladed.
955,"These have low torque ripple, which contributes to good reliability."
956,The blades are usually colored white for daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from .
957,The size and height of turbines increase year by year.
958,Offshore wind turbines are built up to 8 MW today and have a blade length up to .
959,Designs with 10 to 12 MW are in preparation.
960,Usual multi megawatt turbines have tubular steel towers with a height of 70m to 120m and in extremes up to 160m.
961,Vertical-axis wind turbines (or VAWTs) have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically.
962,"One advantage of this arrangement is that the turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind to be effective, which is an advantage on a site where the wind direction is highly variable."
963,It is also an advantage when the turbine is integrated into a building because it is inherently less steerable.
964,"Also, the generator and gearbox can be placed near the ground, using a direct drive from the rotor assembly to the ground-based gearbox, improving accessibility for maintenance."
965,"However, these designs produce much less energy averaged over time, which is a major drawback."
966,"The key disadvantages include the relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, the inherently lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, and the difficulty of modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype."
967,When a turbine is mounted on a rooftop the building generally redirects wind over the roof and this can double the wind speed at the turbine.
968,If the height of a rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence.
969,"While wind speeds within the built environment are generally much lower than at exposed rural sites, noise may be a concern and an existing structure may not adequately resist the additional stress."
970,Subtypes of the vertical axis design include:
971,"Eggbeater"" turbines, or Darrieus turbines, were named after the French inventor, Georges Darrieus."
972,"They have good efficiency, but produce large torque ripple and cyclical stress on the tower, which contributes to poor reliability."
973,"They also generally require some external power source, or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning, because the starting torque is very low."
974,"The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades, which results in greater solidity of the rotor."
975,Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area.
976,Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wires but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing.
977,"A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight, as opposed to curved, blades."
978,The cycloturbine variety has variable pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting.
979,"The advantages of variable pitch are: high starting torque; a wide, relatively flat torque curve; a higher coefficient of performance; more efficient operation in turbulent winds; and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses."
980,"Straight, V, or curved blades may be used."
981,"These are drag-type devices with two (or more) scoops that are used in anemometers, ""Flettner"" vents (commonly seen on bus and van roofs), and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines."
982,They are always self-starting if there are at least three scoops.
983,"Twisted Savonius is a modified savonius, with long helical scoops to provide smooth torque."
984,This is often used as a rooftop wind turbine and has even been adapted for ships.
985,The parallel turbine is similar to the crossflow fan or centrifugal fan.
986,It uses the ground effect.
987,Vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years: a unit producing 10 kW was built by Israeli wind pioneer Bruce Brill in the 1980s.
988,"Wind turbine design is a careful balance of cost, energy output, and fatigue life."
989,These factors are balanced using a range of computer modelling techniques.
990,Wind turbines convert wind energy to electrical energy for distribution.
991,Conventional horizontal axis turbines can be divided into three components:
992,A 1.5 (MW) wind turbine of a type frequently seen in the United States has a tower high.
993,The rotor assembly (blades and hub) weighs .
994,"The nacelle, which contains the generator, weighs ."
995,The concrete base for the tower is constructed using reinforcing steel and contains of concrete.
996,The base is in diameter and thick near the center.
997,"Due to data transmission problems, structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to the nacelle to monitor the gearbox and equipment."
998,"Currently, digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades."
999,These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects.
1000,Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry.
1001,Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines.
1002,Wind turbine rotor blades are being made longer to increase efficiency.
1003,"This requires them to be stiff, strong, light and resistant to fatigue."
1004,"Materials with these properties are composites such as polyester and epoxy, while glass fiber and carbon fiber have been used for the reinforcing."
1005,Construction may use manual layup or injection molding.
1006,Companies seek ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs.
1007,A predominant way has been to increase blade length and thus rotor diameter.
1008,Retrofitting existing turbines with larger blades reduces the work and risks of redesigning the system.
1009,"The current longest blade is 88.4 m (from LM Wind Power), but by 2021 offshore turbines are expected to be 10-MW with 100 m blades."
1010,"Longer blades need to be stiffer to avoid deflection, which requires materials with higher stiffness-to-weight ratio."
1011,"Because the blades need to function over a 100 million load cycles over a period of 20–25 years, the fatigue of the blade materials is also critical."
1012,Materials commonly used in wind turbine blades are described below.
1013,The stiffness of composites is determined by the stiffness of fibers and their volume content.
1014,"Typically, E-glass fibers are used as main reinforcement in the composites."
1015,"Typically, the glass/epoxy composites for wind turbine blades contain up to 75% glass by weight."
1016,"This increases the stiffness, tensile and compression strength."
1017,"A promising composite material is glass fiber with modified compositions like S-glass, R-glass etc."
1018,"Other glass fibers developed by Owens Corning are ECRGLAS, Advantex and WindStrand."
1019,"Carbon fiber has more tensile strength, higher stiffness and lower density than glass fiber."
1020,"An ideal candidate for these properties is the spar cap, a structural element of a blade which experiences high tensile loading."
1021,"A 100-m glass fiber blade could weigh up to 50 metric tons, while using carbon fiber in the spar saves 20% to 30% weight, about 15 metric tons."
1022,"However, because carbon fiber is ten times more expensive, glass fiber is still dominant."
1023,"Instead of making wind turbine blade reinforcements from pure glass or pure carbon, hybrid designs trade weight for cost."
1024,"For example for an 8 m blade, a full replacement by carbon fiber would save 80% of weight but increase costs by 150%, while a 30% replacement would save 50% of weight and increase costs by 90%."
1025,"Hybrid reinforcement materials include E-glass/carbon, E-glass/aramid."
1026,The current longest blade by LM Wind Power is made of carbon/glass hybrid composites.
1027,More research is needed about the optimal composition of materials
1028,"Additions of small amount (0.5 weight %) of nanoreinforcement (carbon nanotubes or nanoclay) in the polymer matrix of composites, fiber sizing or interlaminar layers can improve fatigue resistance, shear or compressive strength, and fracture toughness of the composites by 30% to 80%."
1029,Research has also shown that incorporating small amounts of carbon nanotubes (CNT) can increase the lifetime up to 1500%.
1030,", a wind turbine may cost around $1 million per megawatt."
1031,"For the wind turbine blades, while the material cost is much higher for hybrid glass/carbon fiber blades than all-glass fiber blades, labor costs can be lower."
1032,Using carbon fiber allows simpler designs that use less raw material.
1033,The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies.
1034,"Thinner blades allow reducing the number of layers and so the labor, and in some cases, equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades."
1035,"Wind turbine parts other than the rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely made of steel."
1036,Smaller turbines (as well as megawatt-scale Enercon turbines) have begun using aluminum alloys for these components to make turbines lighter and more efficient.
1037,This trend may grow if fatigue and strength properties can be improved.
1038,"Pre-stressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine."
1039,"Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, which requires magnetic materials."
1040,"In particular, this would require an greater supply of the rare earth metal neodymium."
1041,"Modern turbines use a couple of tons of copper for generators, cables and such."
1042,", global production of wind turbines use 450,000 tonnes of copper per year."
1043,A study of the material consumption trends and requirements for wind energy in Europe found that bigger turbines have a higher consumption of precious metals but lower material input per kW generated.
1044,The current material consumption and stock was compared to input materials for various onshore system sizes.
1045,In all EU countries the estimates for 2020 doubled the values consumed in 2009.
1046,These countries would need to expand their resources to meet the estimated demand for 2020.
1047,"For example, currently the EU has 3% of world supply of fluorspar and it requires 14% by 2020."
1048,"Globally, the main exporting countries are South Africa, Mexico and China."
1049,"This is similar with other critical and valuable materials required for energy systems such as magnesium, silver and indium."
1050,The levels of recycling of these materials are very low and focusing on that could alleviate supply.
1051,"Because most of these valuable materials are also used in other emerging technologies, like light emitting diodes (LEDs), photo voltaics (PVs) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), their demand is expected to grow."
1052,A study by the United States Geological Survey estimated resources required to fulfill the US commitment to supplying 20% of its electricity from wind power by 2030.
1053,It did not consider requirements for small turbines or offshore turbines because those were not common in 2008 when the study was done.
1054,"Common materials such as cast iron, steel and concrete would increase by 2%–3% compared to 2008."
1055,"Between 110,000 and 115,000 metric tons of fiber glass would be required per year, a 14% increase."
1056,"Rare metal use would not increase much compared to available supply, however rare metals that are also used for other technologies such as batteries which are increasing its global demand need to be taken into account."
1057,"Land required would be 50,000 square kilometers onshore and 11,000 offshore."
1058,This would not be a problem in the US due to its vast area and because the same land can be used for farming.
1059,A greater challenge would be the variability and transmission to areas of high demand.
1060,"Permanent magnets for wind turbine generators contain rare metals such as neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), Terbium (Tb) and dysprosium (Dy)."
1061,Systems that use magnetic direct drive turbines require greater amounts of rare metals.
1062,"Therefore, an increase in wind turbine manufacture would increase the demand for these resources."
1063,"By 2035, the demand for Nd is estimated to increase by 4,000 to 18,000 tons and for Dy by 200 to 1200 tons."
1064,These values are a quarter to half of current production.
1065,"However, these estimates are very uncertain because technologies are developing rapidly."
1066,Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and was reducing its export quotas.
1067,"However, in recent years other producers have increased production and China has increased export quotas, leading to an higher supply and lower cost, and a greater viability of large scale use of variable-speed generators."
1068,Glass fiber is the most common material for reinforcement.
1069,"Its demand has grown due to growth in construction, transportation and wind turbines."
1070,"Its global market might reach US$17.4 billion by 2024, compared to US$8.5 billion in 2014."
1071,"In 2014, Asia Pacific produced more than 45% of the market; now China is the largest producer."
1072,The industry receives subsidies from the Chinese government allowing it to export cheaper to the US and Europe.
1073,"However, price wars have led to anti-dumping measures such as tariffs on Chinese glass fiber."
1074,Interest in recycling blades varies in different markets and depends on the waste legislation and local economics.
1075,"A challenge in recycling blades is related to the composite material, which is made of a thermosetting matrix and glass fibers or a combination of glass and carbon fibers."
1076,Thermosetting matrix cannot be remolded to form new composites.
1077,So the options are either to reuse the blade and the composite material elements as they are found in the blade or to transform the composite material into a new source of material.
1078,"In Germany, wind turbine blades are commercially recycled as part of an alternative fuel mix for a cement factory."
1079,"A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers around their bases, or with viewing areas farther away."
1080,"The wind turbines are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education."
1081,"Small wind turbines may be used for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable."
1082,Small wind turbines may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use.
1083,"Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point."
1084,The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts.
1085,"Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind."
1086,"Larger, more costly turbines generally have geared power trains, alternating current output, and flaps, and are actively pointed into the wind."
1087,Direct drive generators and aeroelastic blades for large wind turbines are being researched.
1088,"On most horizontal wind turbine farms, a spacing of about 6–10 times the rotor diameter is often upheld."
1089,"However, for large wind farms distances of about 15 rotor diameters should be more economical, taking into account typical wind turbine and land costs."
1090,"This conclusion has been reached by research conducted by Charles Meneveau of Johns Hopkins University and Johan Meyers of Leuven University in Belgium, based on computer simulations that take into account the detailed interactions among wind turbines (wakes) as well as with the entire turbulent atmospheric boundary layer."
1091,Recent research by John Dabiri of Caltech suggests that vertical wind turbines may be placed much more closely together so long as an alternating pattern of rotation is created allowing blades of neighbouring turbines to move in the same direction as they approach one another.
1092,Wind turbines need regular maintenance to stay reliable and available.
1093,In the best case turbines are available to generate energy 98% of the time.
1094,Modern turbines usually have a small onboard crane for hoisting maintenance tools and minor components.
1095,"However, large, heavy components like generator, gearbox, blades, and so on are rarely replaced, and a heavy lift external crane is needed in those cases."
1096,"If the turbine has a difficult access road, a containerized crane can be lifted up by the internal crane to provide heavier lifting."
1097,Installation of new wind turbines can be controversial.
1098,"An alternative is repowering, where existing wind turbines are replaced with bigger, more powerful ones, sometimes in smaller numbers while keeping or increasing capacity."
1099,Older turbines were in some early cases not required to be removed when reaching the end of their life.
1100,"Some still stand, waiting to be recycled or repowered."
1101,"A demolition industry develops to recycle offshore turbines at a cost of DKK 2–4 million per (MW), to be guaranteed by the owner."
1102,"Wind turbines produce electricity at between two and six cents per kilowatt hour, which is one of the lowest-priced renewable energy sources."
1103,"As technology needed for wind turbines continued to improve, the prices decreased as well."
1104,"In addition, there is currently no competitive market for wind energy, because wind is a freely available natural resource, most of which is untapped."
1105,"The main cost of small wind turbines is the purchase and installation process, which averages between $48,000 and $65,000 per installation."
1106,"The energy harvested from the turbine will offset the installation cost, as well as provide virtually free energy for years."
1107,"Wind turbines provide a clean energy source, use little water, emitting no greenhouse gases and no waste products."
1108,"Over 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide per year can be eliminated by using a one-megawatt turbine instead of one megawatt of energy from a fossil fuel."
1109,"Wind turbines can be very large, reaching over tall and with blades long, and people have often complained about their visual impact."
1110,"Environmental impact of wind power includes effect on wildlife, but can be mitigated if proper monitoring and mitigation strategies are implemented."
1111,"Thousands of birds, including rare species, have been killed by the blades of wind turbines, though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality."
1112,"For every bird killed by a wind turbine in the US, nearly 500,000 are killed by each of feral cats and buildings."
1113,"In comparison, conventional coal fired generators contribute significantly more to bird mortality, by incineration when caught in updrafts of smoke stacks and by poisoning with emissions byproducts (including particulates and heavy metals downwind of flue gases)."
1114,"Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil fuel generators, by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g."
1115,damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by water acidification from combustion monoxides.
1116,"Energy harnessed by wind turbines is intermittent, and is not a ""dispatchable"" source of power; its availability is based on whether the wind is blowing, not whether electricity is needed."
1117,"Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed."
1118,"In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy."
1119,"However, it can form part of the energy mix, which also includes power from other sources."
1120,"Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional (balancing)."
1121,"Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies."
1122,"The Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 1996, is an assessment of the then available scientific and socio-economic information on climate change."
1123,It was superseded by the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001.
1124,"The Second Assessment Report, titled ""Climate Change 1995"", consists of reports from each of the three Working Groups, and a Synthesis Report:"
1125,"These reports were prepared by over two thousand experts, and ""contain the factual basis of the issue of climate change, gleaned from available expert literature and further carefully reviewed by experts and governments."
1126,"The Synthesis Report gave its purpose as providing the scientific, technical and socio-economic information for determining"
1127,"Working Group I, dealing with the scientific aspects of climate, stated that"
1128,"Working Group I subsequently characterized its reports in the First and Second Assessments as progressing from an understanding that the greenhouse effect is well understood, greenhouse gases are increasing (due largely to human activity), and therefore should lead to significant global warming (though lack of understanding limited specific regional predictions), to a greater understanding (despite continuing uncertainties) that global warming continues and is most likely due to human activity, and that very substantial cuts in emissions would be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations."
1129,"Working Group II assessed whether the range of plausible impacts of global warming constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, while Working Group III provided information to help countries ""take decisions they believe are most appropriate for their specific circumstances""."
1130,"In the IPCC process, a ""convening lead author"" for each chapter worked with other lead authors and contributing authors to agree the structure of the chapter, and assign teams of scientists to write each section of the chapter, producing a draft which was subject to acceptance by the whole author group."
1131,"Participating governments then provided review comments on the draft, incorporated into the assessment which was presented to seek acceptance at a plenary session of the IPCC."
1132,The IPCC chairman Bert Bolin had difficulty finding a convening lead author for Chapter 8.
1133,"After delays, Benjamin D. Santer who was doing postdoctoral research on the topic was persuaded to take on the task."
1134,"Twenty participants from various countries met at the initial meeting in Livermore, California, in August 1994 to identify the scientific topic areas, and discussion continued by email."
1135,"At the first drafting session (in Sigtuna, Sweden, in October) Santer persuaded the others that the chapter should discuss observational and model uncertainties, though these were also covered in other chapters."
1136,"The ""zeroth"" draft was then sent out for peer review to scientific topic experts, all the chapter authors and lead authors of other chapters."
1137,Their responses were incorporated in the second drafting session in March 1995 at Brighton.
1138,"In May the entire draft Working Group I report as well as the summary for policymakers was submitted for full ""country review"" by participating governments, to provide comments for incorporation at the third drafting session at Asheville, North Carolina, in July."
1139,"Because of the delayed timing, Santer did not receive government comments for this meeting, some did not arrive until the plenary meeting in November."
1140,"The Chapter 8 draft report put together on 5 October had an Executive Summary of the evidence, and after various qualifications, said ""Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate."
1141,"Governments at the November plenary meeting in Madrid demanded changes to how this was worded in the Summary for Policymakers, after extended discussions Bolin suggested the adjective ""discernible"" and this was agreed."
1142,"The approved Summary for Policymakers includes a section headed ""The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate"", setting out progress in detection and attribution studies, cautioning that ""Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors."
1143,Santer was subsequently required by the IPCC to bring the rest of the chapter into compliance with this wording.
1144,"The summary at the start of the accepted version of the chapter stated that ""these results indicate that the observed trend in global mean temperature over the past 100 years is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin."
1145,"More importantly, there is evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcings by greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate record."
1146,"Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on global climate."
1147,"The final paragraph in the chapter stated ""The body of statistical evidence in Chapter 8, when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system, now points to a discernible human influence on global climate."
1148,"An introductory preface to the SAR written by IPCC chairman Bolin and his co-chairs John T. Houghton and L. Gylvan Meira Filho highlighted ""that observations suggest 'a discernible human influence on global climate', one of the key findings of this report, adds an important new dimension to discussion of the climate issue."
1149,"Prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, the industry group Global Climate Coalition distributed a report entitled ""The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing"" to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists, which said that Santer had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science."
1150,"Three weeks later, and a week after the Second Assessment Report was released, the Global Climate Coalition was echoed in a letter published in The Wall Street Journal from the retired condensed matter physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences, Frederick Seitz, chair of the George C. Marshall Institute and Science and Environmental Policy Project, but not a climatologist."
1151,"In this letter, Seitz alleged that Santer had perpetrated ""a disturbing corruption of the peer-review process."
1152,"Seitz criticized the conclusions of Chapter 8, and wrote that ""key changes were made after the scientists had met and accepted what they thought was the final peer-reviewed version"", deleting ""hints of the skepticism"" he attributed to other unnamed scientists."
1153,"The position of the lead author of Chapter 8, Benjamin D. Santer, was supported by fellow IPCC authors and senior figures of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)."
1154,"The presidents of the AMS and UCAR stated that there was a ""systematic effort by some individuals to undermine and discredit the scientific process that has led many scientists working on understanding climate to conclude that there is a very real possibility that humans are modifying Earth's climate on a global scale."
1155,"Other rebuttals of Seitz's comments include a 1997 paper by Paul Edwards and IPCC author Stephen Schneider, and a 2007 complaint to the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom about the television programme, ""The Great Global Warming Swindle""."
1156,"The 2007 complaint includes a rebuttal of Seitz's claims by the former IPCC chairman, Bert Bolin."
1157,"One of the controversies of the Second Assessment Working Group III report is the economic valuation of human life, which is used in monetized (i.e., converted into US dollar values) estimates of climate change impacts."
1158,"Often in these monetized estimates, the health risks of climate change are valued so that they are ""consistent"" with valuations of other health risks."
1159,There are a wide range of views on monetized estimates of climate change impacts.
1160,The strengths and weaknesses of monetized estimates are discussed in the SAR and later IPCC assessments.
1161,"In the preparation of the SAR, disagreement arose over the Working Group III Summary for Policymakers (SPM)."
1162,"The SPM is written by a group of IPCC authors, who then discuss the draft with government delegates from all of the UNFCCC Parties (i.e., delegates from most of the world's governments)."
1163,"The economic valuation of human life (referred to by economists as the ""value of statistical life"") was viewed by some governments (such as India) as suggesting that people living in poor countries are worth less than people living in rich countries."
1164,"David Pearce, who was a lead author of the relevant chapter of the SAR, officially dissented on the SPM."
1165,According to Pearce:
1166,"The relevant chapter [of the Report] values of statistical life based on actual studies in different countries [...] What the authors of Chapter 6 did not accept, and still do not accept, was the call from a few [government] delegates for a common valuation based on the highest number for willingness to pay."
1167,"In other words, a few government delegates wanted ""statistical lives"" in poor countries to be valued at the same level as ""statistical lives"" in rich countries."
1168,IPCC author Michael Grubb later commented:
1169,Many of us think that the governments were basically right.
1170,The metric [used by Pearce] makes sense for determining how a given government might make tradeoffs between its own internal projects.
1171,But the same logic fails when the issue is one of damage inflicted by some countries on others: why should the deaths inflicted by the big emitters — principally the industrialised countries — be valued differently according to the wealth of the victims' countries?
1172,"The Second Assessment Report consists of the following reports from each of the three Working Groups, and a Synthesis Report."
1173,The WG2 report has on-line text; all are available in PDF format at the IPCC's documents web page.
1174,"In November 2017, 15,364 scientists signed a World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice written by lead author professor of ecology, William J. Ripple of Oregon State University, along with 7 co-authors calling for, among other things, limiting population growth, and drastically diminishing per capita consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other resources."
1175,"The Second Notice included 9 time-series graphs of key indicators, each correlated to a specific issue mentioned in the original 1992 warning, to show that most environmental issues are continuing to trend in the wrong direction, most with no discernible change in rate."
1176,The article included 13 specific steps humanity could take to transition to sustainability.
1177,The Second Notice has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published.
1178,"The full warning was published in ""BioScience"" and it can still be endorsed on the Scientists Warning website."
1179,"In late 1992, the late Henry W. Kendall, a former chair of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) board of directors, wrote the first warning World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, which begins: ""Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course."
1180,"A majority of the Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences signed the document; about 1,700 of the world's leading scientists appended their signature."
1181,"It was sometimes offered in opposition to the Heidelberg Appeal—also signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992—which begins by criticizing ""an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress, and impedes economic and social development."
1182,This document was often cited by those who oppose theories relating to climate change.
1183,"However, the Heidelberg Appeal offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of environmental science: ""We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved."
1184,"But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions."
1185,"In contrast, the UCS-led petition contains specific recommendations: ""We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water."
1186,... We must stabilize population.
1187,"Business action on climate change includes a range of activities relating to global warming, and to influencing political decisions on global-warming-related regulation, such as the Kyoto Protocol."
1188,"Major multinationals have played and to some extent continue to play a significant role in the politics of global warming, especially in the United States, through lobbying of government and funding of global warming deniers."
1189,"Business also plays a key role in the mitigation of global warming, through decisions to invest in researching and implementing new energy technologies and energy efficiency measures."
1190,(See also individual and political action on climate change.)
1191,"In 1989 in the US, the petroleum and automotive industries and the National Association of Manufacturers created the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming."
1192,"In 1997, when the US Senate overwhelmingly passed a resolution against ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, the industry funded a $13 million industry advertising blitz in the run-up to the vote."
1193,"In 1998 ""The New York Times"" published an American Petroleum Institute (API) memo outlining a strategy aiming to make ""recognition of uncertainty ... part of the 'conventional wisdom."
1194,"The memo has been compared to a late 1960s memo by tobacco company Brown and Williamson, which observed: ""Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public."
1195,It is also the means of establishing a controversy.
1196,"Those involved in the memo included Jeffrey Salmon, then executive director of the George C. Marshall Institute, Steven Milloy, a prominent denialist commentator, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Myron Ebell."
1197,"In June 2005 a former API lawyer, Philip Cooney, resigned his White House post after accusations of politically motivated tampering with scientific reports."
1198,"In 2002 the GCC considered its work in the US against regulation on global warming to have been so successful that it ""deactivated"" itself, although the loss of some leading members may also have been a factor."
1199,"At the same time, since 1989 many previously denialist petroleum and automobile industry corporations have changed their position as the political and scientific consensus has grown, with the creation of the Kyoto Protocol and the publication of the International Panel on Climate Change's Second and Third Assessment Reports."
1200,"These corporations include major petroleum companies like Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco, and BP, as well as automobile manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler."
1201,"Some of these have joined with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change), a non-profit organization aiming to support efforts to address global climate change."
1202,"Since 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project has been working with major corporations and investors to disclose the emissions of the largest companies."
1203,"By 2007, the CDP published the emissions data for 2400 of the largest corporations in the world, and represented major institutional investors with $41 trillion combined assets under management."
1204,The pressure from these investors had had some success in working with companies to reduce emissions.
1205,"The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a CEO-led association of some 200 multinational companies, has called on governments to agree on a global targets, and suggests that it is necessary to cut emissions by 60-80 percent from current levels by 2050."
1206,"In 2017, after the election of Donald Trump, backing was shown in the business community for the Paris Agreement, which became effective November 4, 2016."
1207,"A central organization in climate denial was the Global Climate Coalition (1989–2002), a group of mainly United States businesses opposing immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
1208,"The coalition funded deniers with scientific credentials to be public spokespeople, provided industry a voice on climate change, and fought the Kyoto Protocol."
1209,"The New York Times"" reported that ""even as the coalition worked to sway opinion [towards denial], its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted."
1210,"In the year 2000, the rate of corporate members leaving accelerated when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by John Passacantando and Phil Radford with the organization Ozone Action."
1211,"According to ""The New York Times"", when Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition, it was “the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.” After that, between December 1999 and early March 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the Southern Company and General Motors."
1212,"The organization closed in 2002, or in their own words, 'deactivated'."
1213,The U.S.
1214,Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) was formed in January 2007 with the primary goal of influencing the US government's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
1215,"Original members included General Electric, Alcoa, Natural Resources Defense Council, etc., but they were joined in April, 2007 by ConocoPhilips and AIG."
1216,"ExxonMobil has been a leading figure in the business world's position on climate change, providing substantial funding to a range of global-warming-denialist organizations."
1217,"Mother Jones"" counted some 40 ExxonMobil-funded organization that ""either have sought to undermine mainstream scientific findings on global climate change or have maintained affiliations with a small group of ""skeptic"" (denialist) scientists who continue to do so."
1218,Between 2000 and 2003 these organizations received more than $8m in funding.
1219,"It has also had a key influence in the Bush administration's energy policy, including on the Kyoto Protocol, supported by both $55m spent on lobbying since 1999, and direct contacts between the company and leading politicians."
1220,It was a leading member of the Global Climate Coalition.
1221,"It encouraged (and may have been instrumental in) the replacement in 2002 of the head of the IPCC, Robert Watson."
1222,"It has also invested $100m into the Global Climate and Energy Project, with Stanford University, and other programs at institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Research and Development Program."
1223,"Some of Exxon's activities on climate change produced strong criticism from environmental groups, including reactions such as a leaflet produced by the Stop Esso campaign, saying 'Don't buy E$$o', and featuring a tiger hand setting fire to the Earth."
1224,"The company's carbon dioxide emissions are more than 50% higher than those of British rival BP, despite the US firm's oil and gas production being only slightly larger."
1225,"According to a 2004 study commissioned by Friends of the Earth, ExxonMobil and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002."
1226,The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.
1227,"BP left the Global Climate Coalition in 1997 and said that global warming was a problem that had to be dealt with, although it subsequently joined others in lobbying the Australian government not to sign the Kyoto Protocol unless the US did."
1228,"In March 2002 BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, declared in a speech that global warming was real and that urgent action was needed, saying that ""Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.""."
1229,"In 2005 BP was considering testing carbon sequestration in one of its North Sea oil fields, by pumping carbon dioxide into them (and thereby also increasing yields)."
1230,"Throughout 2006 BP, led by their CEO Lord John Browne, has continued to take a leadership stance on climate change."
1231,It has cut its own operational emissions of CO by 10%.
1232,It is investing $8 billion in renewable energy over the next 10 years.
1233,And most recently it has launched a 'target zero' campaign in the UK to encourage its customers to offset their vehicle emissions when they fill up at the petrol station.

1240,"American Electric Power, the world's largest private producer of carbon dioxide, said in 2005 that targets for carbon reduction ""represent a common-sense approach that can begin the process of lowering emissions along a gradual, cost-effective path."
1241,"The company complained that ""uncertainties over the cost of carbon"" made it very difficult to make decisions about capital investment."
1242,"DuPont has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% since 1990, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in the process."

1249,Vectrix produces and sells an electric scooter rated for 100 km/h (60 mph).
1250,"There has also been greatly increased interest in personal rapid transit, which applies system engineering principles to reduce energy use, eliminate traffic jams, and produce an acceptable substitute to replace cars, all at the same time."
1251,"Most systems fully meet Kyoto Treaty carbon emission goals now, 60 years ahead of schedule."
1252,"Korean steel maker POSCO and its partner Vectus Ltd. have produced a working safety case, including test track and vehicles, that remains fully functional in Swedish winters."

1265,"In the UK, some newspapers (""Daily Mail"", ""Daily Telegraph"") are significantly anti-science, while most others (with varying enthusiasm, ""The Independent"" giving it most prominence) support action on global warming."
1266,"Overall, British newspapers have given the issue three times more coverage than US newspapers."
1267,"In 2006 (""British Sky Broadcasting"" (Sky) became the world's first media company to go 'climate neutral' by purchasing enough carbon offsets."
1268,"The CEO of the company James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch and heir apparent for the News International empire) is a strong advocate of action on climate change and is thought to be influential on the issue within the wider group of companies, ""The Sun"" announced it was ""going green"" and now covers the global warming issue extensively."
1269,"In June 2006, to much industry interest, Rupert Murdoch invited Al Gore to make his climate change presentation at the annual News Corp (including the Fox Network) gathering at the Pebble Beach golf resort, (USA)."
1270,"In August 2007, Rupert Murdoch announced plans for News Corp. to be carbon neutral by 2010."
1271,Businesses take action on climate change for several reasons.
1272,"Action improves corporate image and better aligns corporate actions with the environmental interests of owners, employees, suppliers, and customers."
1273,"Action also occurs to reduce costs, increase return on investments, and to reduce dependency on uncontrollable costs."
1274,"For many companies, looking at more efficient energy use can pay off in the medium to long term; unfortunately, shareholders need to be satisfied in the short term, so regulatory intervention is often required, to encourage prudent conservation measures."
1275,"However, as carbon intensity starts to show up on balance books through organizations such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, voluntary action is starting to take place."
1276,Recently there has been a spate of companies acting to improve their energy efficiency.
1277,Possibly the most prominent of these companies is Wal-Mart.
1278,"Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the US, has announced specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores and pressure its 60,000 suppliers in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead."
1279,"On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% over the next three years and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg."
1280,"This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year."
1281,The company also wants to build a store that is at least 25% more energy efficient within four years.
1282,"In August 2002, the largest gathering of ministers in the history of the world met at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg."
1283,"The global environmental community discussed the role of renewables and energy efficiency in lowering carbon emissions, mitigating poverty reduction (energy access) and improving energy security."
1284,One result from WSSD was the formation of to carry forward the international dialogue on sustainable energy and its role in the energy mix.
1285,"Partnerships formed include the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership, the Global Village Energy Partnership, the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC), and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development."
1286,Renewable energies and renewable energy technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts.
1287,"These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's)."
1288,"For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer."
1289,Numerous studies have shown that the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale.
1290,"Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously."
1291,A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company.
1292,A happier workforce is a more productive workforce.
1293,"More directly, the high petroleum (oil) and gas prices of 2005 have only added to the attraction of renewable energy sources."
1294,"Although most renewable energies are more expensive at current fuel prices, the difference is narrowing, and uncertainty in oil and gas markets is a factor worth considering for highly energy-intensive businesses."
1295,Another factor affecting the uptake of renewable energies in Europe is the EU Energy Trading Scheme (ETS or EUTS).
1296,"Many large businesses are fined for increases in emissions, but can sell any ""excess"" reductions they make."
1297,"Companies with high-profile renewable energy portfolios include an aluminium smelter (Alcan), a cement company (Lafarge), and a microchip manufacturer (Intel)."
1298,"Many examples of corporate leadership in this area can be found on the website of The Climate Group, an independent organization set up for promoting such action by business and government."
1299,"The principle of carbon offset is fairly simple: a business decides that it doesn't want to contribute further to global warming, and it has already made efforts to reduce its carbon (dioxide) emissions, so it decides to pay someone else to further reduce its net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies."
1300,Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees—or not emitted due to funding of renewable energy deployment—offsets the emissions from fossil fuel use.
1301,"In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or tree planting—particularly in developing nations—can be a relatively cheap way of making an event, project, or business ""carbon neutral""."
1302,Many carbon offset providers—some as inexpensive as $0.10 per ton of carbon dioxide—are referenced in the Carbon Offset article of this encyclopedia.
1303,Many businesses are now looking to carbon offset all their work.
1304,An example of a business going carbon neutral is FIFA: their 2006 World Cup Final will be carbon neutral.
1305,"FIFA estimate they are offsetting one hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide created by the event, largely as a result of people travelling there."
1306,"Other carbon neutral companies include the bank HSBC, the consumer staples manufacturer Annie's Homegrown, world leading society publisher Blackwell Publishing, and the publishing house New Society Publishers."
1307,The Guardian newspaper also offsets its carbon emissions resulting from international air travel.
1308,"Laurie Ellen David (née Lennard; born March 22, 1958) is an American environmental activist."
1309,"She produced the Academy Award-winning ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and, most recently, teamed up with Katie Couric to executive produce ""Fed Up"", a film about the causes of obesity in the United States."
1310,"She serves as a trustee on the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of the Advisory Board of the Children's Nature Institute and is a contributing blogger to ""The Huffington Post""."
1311,Laurie Ellen Lennard was born and raised in a middle class Jewish family on Long Island.
1312,"In 1979, she graduated from Ohio University with a degree in journalism."
1313,"She was married for 14 years to Larry David (co-creator of ""Seinfeld"" and creator of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"")."
1314,"They married in 1993, and Laurie David filed for divorce on July 19, 2007."
1315,"They have two daughters, Cazzie Laurel (b."
1316,"May 10, 1994) and Romy March (b."
1317,"March 2, 1996)."
1318,"Before working full-time on environmental and political issues, David worked in the entertainment industry."
1319,She began her career in New York City as a talent coordinator for the Late Show with David Letterman.
1320,"Four years later she left to start her own management company, representing comedians and comedy writers."
1321,"She also produced several comedy specials for HBO, Showtime, MTV, and Fox Television."
1322,"Upon moving to Los Angeles, she became vice president of comedy development for a division of Fox Broadcasting and developed sitcoms for 20th Century Fox Television."
1323,Laurie David has worked publicly on projects aimed at stopping climate change.
1324,"She founded the ""Stop Global Warming Virtual March"" with Senator John McCain and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ""Ms."" magazine quoted Laurie David about the grassroots aspect of her campaign: ""If everyone does one thing, they are likely to do two things, then three things."
1325,"Then they are likely to influence friends and family, and that's how you build a movement."
1326,"In addition to the Virtual March, David has produced other projects to bring the issue of climate change into mainstream popular culture, including the release of her first book, ""Stop Global Warming: The Solution Is You!"
1327,", and the comedy special, ""Earth to America!"
1328,"for TBS, which aired November 20, 2005."
1329,"Aside from the Academy Award-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"", David produced HBO's ""Too Hot Not to Handle"" (a documentary on the effects of climate change in the United States), which aired on April 22, 2006."
1330,"Laurie David also appeared in ""Big Ideas for a Small Planet"", an environmentalist documentary series on the Sundance Channel."
1331,"In an interview with ""The Guardian"" in November 2006, David acknowledged that owning two homes on opposite sides of the country and flying in a private jet several times per year is at odds with her message to others."
1332,"In the interview she notes ""Yes, I take a private plane on holiday a couple of times a year, and I feel horribly guilty about it."
1333,I probably shouldn't do it.
1334,"But the truth is, I'm not perfect."
1335,This is not about perfection.
1336,I don't expect anybody else to be perfect either.
1337,That's what hurts the environmental movement – holding people to a standard they cannot meet.
1338,That just pushes people away.
1339,"In 2005, and then again in 2009, David was cited by the Chilmark Conservation Commission for paving over protected wetland areas on her estate on Martha's Vineyard."
1340,"As a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council and a founding member of The Detroit Project , David has spearheaded numerous public education and action campaigns urging Congress and auto-makers to raise fuel efficiency standards and make higher mileage cars."
1341,"In January 2004, the NRDC opened the David Family Environmental Action Center."
1342,"Endowed by the David family, the Center promotes activism to protect the environment."
1343,"It features exhibits on issues such as global warming, ocean pollution, everyday toxins, and green building solutions."
1344,"In 2003, she was honored by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s organization, Riverkeeper."
1345,She also received the Los Angeles-based Children's Nature Institute's Leaf Award in 2003 for her commitment to the environmental education of young children.
1346,"In October 2006, David was featured in ""Glamour"" as one of its “Women of the Year”."
1347,She received the Gracie Allen Award for Individual Achievement by the American Women in Radio & Television and the NRDC's 2006 Forces for Nature award for her work against global warming.
1348,"David's book ""The Family Dinner"" was published in 2010, with recipes by Kirstin Uhrenholdt, a foreword by Harvey Karp and an afterword by Jonathan Safran Foer."
1349,The book advocated for a return to the domestic tradition of an evening meal (sometimes called supper) shared around the family table.
1350,"David's book included recipes, ""rules"" for an effective dinner system, suggestions for stimulating conversation, a survey of ways different cultures say grace, and ways to include grandparents."
1351,"Serotiny is an ecological adaptation exhibited by some seed plants, in which seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger, rather than spontaneously at seed maturation."
1352,"The most common and best studied trigger is fire, and the term ""serotiny"" is often used to refer to this specific case."
1353,"The term has also been used in the more general sense of plants that release their seed over a long period of time, irrespective of whether release is spontaneous; in this sense the term is synonymous with bradyspory."
1354,Possible triggers include:
1355,Some plants may respond to more than one of these triggers.
1356,"For example, ""Pinus halepensis"" exhibits primarily fire-mediated serotiny, but responds weakly to drying atmospheric conditions."
1357,"Similarly, Sierras sequoias and some ""Banksia"" species are strongly serotinous with respect to fire, but also release some seed in response to plant or branch death."
1358,Serotiny can occur in various degrees.
1359,"Plants that retain all of their seed indefinitely in the absence of a trigger event are ""strongly serotinous""."
1360,"Plants that eventually release some of their seed spontaneously in the absence of a trigger are ""weakly serotinous""."
1361,"Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a trigger event curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, but may be termed ""facultatively serotinous""."
1362,"In the southern hemisphere, fire-mediated serotiny is found in angiosperms in fire-prone parts of Australia and South Africa."
1363,"It is extremely common in the Proteaceae of these areas, and also occurs in other taxa, such as ""Eucalyptus"" (Myrtaceae) and even exceptionally in ""Erica sessiliflora"" (Ericaceae)."
1364,"In the northern hemisphere, it is found in a range of conifer taxa, including species of ""Pinus"", ""Cupressus"", ""Sequoiadendron"", and more rarely ""Picea""."
1365,"Since even non-serotinous cones and woody fruits can provide protection from the heat of fire, the key adaptation of fire-induced serotiny is seed storage in a canopy seed bank, which can be released by fire."
1366,"The fire-release mechanism is commonly a resin that seals the fruit or cone scales shut, but which melts when heated."
1367,"This mechanism is refined in some ""Banksia"" by the presence inside the follicle of a winged seed separator which blocks the opening, preventing the seed from falling out."
1368,"Thus the follicles open after fire, but seed release does not occur."
1369,"As the cone dries, wetting by rain or humidity causes the cone scales to expand and reflex, promoting seed release."
1370,"The seed separator thus acts as a lever against the seeds, gradually prying them out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles."
1371,"The effect of this adaptation is to ensure that seed release occurs not in response to fire, but in response to the onset of rains following fire."
1372,The relative importance of serotiny can vary among populations of the same plant species.
1373,"For example, North American populations of lodgepole pine (""Pinus contorta"") can vary from being highly serotinous to having no serotiny at all, opening annually to release seed."
1374,"Different levels of cone serotiny have been linked to variations in the local fire regime: areas that experience more frequent crown-fire tend to have high rates of serotiny, while areas with infrequent crown-fire have low levels of serotiny."
1375,"Additionally, herbivory of lodgepole pines can make fire-mediated serotiny less advantageous in a population."
1376,"Red squirrels (""Sciurus vulgaris"") and red crossbills (""Loxia curvirostra"") will eat seeds, and so serotinous cones, which last in the canopy longer, are more likely to be chosen."
1377,Serotiny occurs less frequently in areas where this seed predation is common.
1378,"Pyriscence can be understood as an adaptation to an environment in which fires are regular, and in which post-fire environments offer the best germination and seedling survival rates."
1379,"In Australia, for example, fire-mediated serotiny occurs in areas that are not only prone to regular fires, but also possess oligotrophic soils and a seasonally dry climate."
1380,"This results in intense competition for nutrients and moisture, leading to very low seedling survival rates."
1381,"The passage of fire, however, reduces competition by clearing out undergrowth, and results in an ash bed that temporarily increases soil nutrition; thus the survival rates of post-fire seedlings in greatly increased."
1382,"Furthermore, releasing a large number of seeds at once, rather than gradually, increases the possibility that some of those seeds will escape predation."
1383,"Similar pressures apply in Northern Hemisphere conifer forests, but in this case there is the further issue of allelopathic leaf litter, which suppresses seed germination."
1384,"Fire clears out this litter, eliminating this obstacle to germination."
1385,"Serotinous adaptations occur in at least 530 species in 40 genera, in multiple (paraphyletic) lineages."
1386,"Serotiny likely evolved separately in these species, but may in some cases have been lost by the related non-serotinous species."
1387,"In the genus ""Pinus"", serotiny likely evolved because of the atmospheric conditions during the Cretaceous period."
1388,The atmosphere during the Cretaceous had higher oxygen and carbon dioxide levels than our atmosphere.
1389,"Fire occurred more frequently than it does currently, and plant growth was high enough to create an abundance of flammable material."
1390,"Many ""Pinus"" species adapted to this fire-prone environment with serotinous pine cones."
1391,A set of conditions must be met in order for long-term seed storage to be evolutionarily viable for a plant:
1392,The genus Taricha consists of four species of highly poisonous newts in the family Salamandridae.
1393,"Their common name is Pacific newts, sometimes also western newts or roughskin newts."
1394,"The four species within this genus are the California newt, the rough-skinned newt, the red-bellied newt, and the sierra newt, all of which are found on the Pacific coastal region from southern Alaska to southern California, with one species possibly ranging into northern Baja California, Mexico."
1395,"Genus ""Taricha"" contains the following species:"
1396,"The rough-skinned newt and the California newt are very similar in appearance, and it can be extremely difficult to differentiate between the species."
1397,Both are light-brown to black on the upper body and orange to yellow on the underbelly.
1398,"They have granulated skin, and they may grow to a length of eight inches."
1399,"However, rough-skinned newts have small eyes with dark lower eyelids, while California newts have large eyes and light lower eyelids."
1400,"Also, rough-skinned newts' upper teeth form a V shape, while those of the California newt form a Y shape, but this is difficult to ascertain on a living specimen."
1401,"The red-bellied newt is brown on the upper body with a red underbelly, has grainy skin, and grows to between 5.5 and 7.5 in."
1402,"It can be distinguished from other coastal newts, not only by its red belly, but also by the lack of yellow in its eyes."
1403,Breeding males develop smooth skin and a flattened tail.
1404,"Taricha"" spp."
1405,"eat a diet largely consisting of invertebrates, though adults will also take fish and amphibian eggs."
1406,"Most predators associate bright colors with poison (called aposematism), so if attacked, the newt will take up a defensive position, showing off the bright underbelly."
1407,"Newts of this genus are primarily nocturnal, and may be either fully aquatic or semiaquatic."
1408,None are fully terrestrial as they must enter the water to breed.
1409,"Juvenile newts, which are known as ""efts"", are primarily terrestrial until they reach sexual maturity."
1410,"All species within the genus ""Taricha"" possess the biotoxin tetrodotoxin."
1411,"However, toxicity varies between species and between populations within a species."
1412,"In general, the rough-skinned newt is the most toxic species."
1413,Their populations in northern Oregon are more toxic than those from California and Washington.
1414,"Those on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, possess little or no tetrodotoxin."
1415,"Taricha"" newts can be lethal to humans if ingested, and at least one human fatality occurred in Oregon from eating a rough-skinned newt."
1416,"Eastern newts of the genus ""Notophthalmus"" (= ""Diemictylus"" of earlier authors) also secrete tetrodotoxin, but in lesser amounts."
1417,"When handling ""Taricha"" specimens, the toxins should not be allowed to come in contact with broken skin or mucous membranes."
1418,"Proper hand washing after handling should prevent any problems with ingestion of tetrodotoxin (as well as infection from ""Salmonella"" which newts may carry), though some individuals are known to be allergic to skin contact with the toxin."

1420,The United Nations Climate Change Conferences are yearly conferences held in the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
1421,"They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties (Conference of the Parties, COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change, and beginning in the mid-1990s, to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
1422,"From 2005 the Conferences have also served as the ""Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol"" (CMP); also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers."
1423,"From 2011 the meetings have also been used to negotiate the Paris Agreement as part of the Durban platform activities until its conclusion in 2015, which created a general path towards climate action."
1424,The first UN Climate Change Conference was held in 1995 in Berlin.
1425,"The first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties took place from 28 March to 7 April 1995 in Berlin, Germany."
1426,It voiced concerns about the adequacy of countries' abilities to meet commitments under the Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (BSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI).
1427,"COP 1 agreed on ""Activities Implemented Jointly"", first joint measures in international climate action."
1428,"COP 2 took place in July 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland."
1429,"Its ministerial declaration was noted (but not adopted) on 18 July 1996, and reflected a United States position statement presented by Timothy Wirth, former Under Secretary for Global Affairs for the United States Department of State at that meeting, which:"
1430,"COP 3 took place in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan."
1431,"After intensive negotiations, it adopted the Kyoto Protocol, which outlined the greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation for Annex I countries, along with what came to be known as Kyoto mechanisms such as emissions trading, clean development mechanism and joint implementation."
1432,"Most industrialized countries and some central European economies in transition (all defined as Annex B countries) agreed to legally binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of an average of 6 to 8% below 1990 levels between the years 2008–2012, defined as the first emissions budget period."
1433,The United States would be required to reduce its total emissions an average of 7% below 1990 levels; however Congress did not ratify the treaty after Clinton signed it.
1434,The Bush administration explicitly rejected the protocol in 2001.
1435,COP 4 took place in November 1998 in Buenos Aires.
1436,It had been expected that the remaining issues unresolved in Kyoto would be finalized at this meeting.
1437,"However, the complexity and difficulty of finding agreement on these issues proved insurmountable, and instead the parties adopted a 2-year ""Plan of Action"" to advance efforts and to devise mechanisms for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, to be completed by 2000."
1438,"During COP4, Argentina and Kazakhstan expressed their commitment to take on the greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation, the first two non-Annex countries to do so."
1439,"COP 5 took place between 25 October and 5 November 1999, in Bonn, Germany."
1440,"It was primarily a technical meeting, and did not reach major conclusions."
1441,"COP 6 took place on 13–25 November 2000, in The Hague, Netherlands."
1442,The discussions evolved rapidly into a high-level negotiation over the major political issues.
1443,"These included major controversy over the United States' proposal to allow credit for carbon ""sinks"" in forests and agricultural lands that would satisfy a major proportion of the U.S. emissions reductions in this way; disagreements over consequences for non-compliance by countries that did not meet their emission reduction targets; and difficulties in resolving how developing countries could obtain financial assistance to deal with adverse effects of climate change and meet their obligations to plan for measuring and possibly reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
1444,"In the final hours of COP 6, despite some compromises agreed between the United States and some EU countries, notably the United Kingdom, the EU countries as a whole, led by Denmark and Germany, rejected the compromise positions, and the talks in The Hague collapsed."
1445,"Jan Pronk, the President of COP 6, suspended COP-6 without agreement, with the expectation that negotiations would later resume."
1446,"It was later announced that the COP 6 meetings (termed ""COP 6 bis"") would be resumed in Bonn, Germany, in the second half of July."
1447,"The next regularly scheduled meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC, COP 7, had been set for Marrakech, Morocco, in October–November 2001."
1448,"COP 6 negotiations resumed on 17–27 July 2001, in Bonn, Germany, with little progress having been made in resolving the differences that had produced an impasse in The Hague."
1449,"However, this meeting took place after George W. Bush had become the President of the United States and had rejected the Kyoto Protocol in March 2001; as a result the United States delegation to this meeting declined to participate in the negotiations related to the Protocol and chose to take the role of observer at the meeting."
1450,"As the other parties negotiated the key issues, agreement was reached on most of the major political issues, to the surprise of most observers, given the low expectations that preceded the meeting."
1451,The agreements included:
1452,"A number of operational details attendant upon these decisions remained to be negotiated and agreed upon, and these were the major issues considered by the COP 7 meeting that followed."
1453,"At the COP 7 meeting in Marrakech, Morocco from 29 October to 10 November 2001, negotiators wrapped up the work on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, finalizing most of the operational details and setting the stage for nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
1454,The completed package of decisions is known as the Marrakech Accords.
1455,"The United States delegation maintained its observer role, declining to participate actively in the negotiations."
1456,"Other parties continued to express hope that the United States would re-engage in the process at some point and worked to achieve ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the requisite number of countries to bring it into force (55 countries needed to ratify it, including those accounting for 55% of developed-country emissions of carbon dioxide in 1990)."
1457,The date of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (August–September 2002) was put forward as a target to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force.
1458,"The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa."
1459,The main decisions at COP 7 included:
1460,"Taking place from 23 October to 1 November 2002, in New Delhi COP 8 adopted the Delhi Ministerial Declaration that, amongst others, called for efforts by developed countries to transfer technology and minimize the impact of climate change on developing countries."
1461,It is also approved the New Delhi work programme on Article 6 of the Convention.
1462,"The COP8 was marked by Russia's hesitation, stating that it needed more time to think it over."
1463,"The Kyoto Protocol could enter into force once it was ratified by 55 countries, including countries responsible for 55 per cent of the developed world's 1990 carbon dioxide emissions."
1464,"With the United States (36.1 per cent share of developed-world carbon dioxide) and Australia refusing ratification, Russia's agreement (17% of global emissions in 1990) was required to meet the ratification criteria and therefore Russia could delay the process."
1465,COP 9 took place on 1–12 December 2003 in Milan.
1466,The parties agreed to use the Adaptation Fund established at COP7 in 2001 primarily in supporting developing countries better adapt to climate change.
1467,The fund would also be used for capacity-building through technology transfer.
1468,"At COP9, the parties also agreed to review the first national reports submitted by 110 non-Annex I countries."
1469,COP 10 took place on 6–17 December 2004.
1470,"COP10 discussed the progress made since the first Conference of the Parties 10 years ago and its future challenges, with special emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation."
1471,"To promote developing countries better adapt to climate change, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action was adopted."
1472,"The parties also began discussing the post-Kyoto mechanism, on how to allocate emission reduction obligation following 2012, when the first commitment period ends."
1473,"COP 11/CMP 1 took place between 28 November and 9 December 2005, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada."
1474,"It was the first ""Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol"" (CMP 1) since their initial meeting in Kyoto in 1997."
1475,It was one of the largest intergovernmental conferences on climate change ever.
1476,The event marked the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
1477,"Hosting more than 10,000 delegates, it was one of Canada's largest international events ever and the largest gathering in Montreal since Expo 67."
1478,"The Montreal Action Plan was an agreement to ""extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol beyond its 2012 expiration date and negotiate deeper cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions""."
1479,"Canada's environment minister, at the time, Stéphane Dion, said the agreement provides a ""map for the future""."
1480,"COP 12/CMP 2 took place on 6–17 November 2006 in Nairobi, Kenya."
1481,"At the meeting, BBC reporter Richard Black coined the phrase ""climate tourists"" to describe some delegates who attended ""to see Africa, take snaps of the wildlife, the poor, dying African children and women""."
1482,"Black also noted that due to delegates concerns over economic costs and possible losses of competitiveness, the majority of the discussions avoided any mention of reducing emissions."
1483,Black concluded that was a disconnect between the political process and the scientific imperative.
1484,"Despite such criticism, certain strides were made at COP12, including in the areas of support for developing countries and clean development mechanism."
1485,"The parties adopted a five-year plan of work to support climate change adaptation by developing countries, and agreed on the procedures and modalities for the Adaptation Fund."
1486,They also agreed to improve the projects for clean development mechanism.
1487,"COP 13/CMP 3 took place on 3–17 December 2007, at Nusa Dua, in Bali, Indonesia."
1488,Agreement on a timeline and structured negotiation on the post-2012 framework (the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol) was achieved with the adoption of the Bali Action Plan (Decision 1/CP.13).
1489,The Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) was established as a new subsidiary body to conduct the negotiations aimed at urgently enhancing the implementation of the Convention up to and beyond 2012.
1490,Decision 9/CP.13 is an Amended to the New Delhi work programme.
1491,"These negotiations took place during 2008 (leading to COP 14/CMP 4 in Poznan, Poland) and 2009 (leading to COP 15/CMP 5 in Copenhagen)."
1492,"COP 14/CMP 4 took place on 1–12 December 2008 in Poznań, Poland."
1493,Delegates agreed on principles for the financing of a fund to help the poorest nations cope with the effects of climate change and they approved a mechanism to incorporate forest protection into the efforts of the international community to combat climate change.
1494,Negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol were the primary focus of the conference.
1495,"COP 15 took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 7–18 December 2009."
1496,The overall goal for the COP 15/CMP 5 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark was to establish an ambitious global climate agreement for the period from 2012 when the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol expires.
1497,"However, on 14 November 2009, the ""New York Times"" announced that ""President Obama and other world leaders have decided to put off the difficult task of reaching a climate change agreement... agreeing instead to make it the mission of the Copenhagen conference to reach a less specific ""politically binding"" agreement that would punt the most difficult issues into the future""."
1498,Ministers and officials from 192 countries took part in the Copenhagen meeting and in addition there were participants from a large number of civil society organizations.
1499,"As many Annex 1 industrialized countries are now reluctant to fulfill commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, a large part of the diplomatic work that lays the foundation for a post-Kyoto agreement was undertaken up to the COP15."
1500,The conference did not achieve a binding agreement for long-term action.
1501,"A 13-paragraph 'political accord' was negotiated by approximately 25 parties including US and China, but it was only 'noted' by the COP as it is considered an external document, not negotiated within the UNFCCC process."
1502,"The accord was notable in that it referred to a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach US$30 billion for the period 2010–2012."
1503,"Longer-term options on climate financing mentioned in the accord are being discussed within the UN Secretary General's High Level Advisory Group on Climate Financing, which is due to report in November 2010."
1504,The negotiations on extending the Kyoto Protocol had unresolved issues as did the negotiations on a framework for long-term cooperative action.
1505,The working groups on these tracks to the negotiations are now due to report to COP 16 and CMP 6 in Mexico.
1506,"COP 16 was held in Cancún, Mexico, from 28 November to 10 December 2010."
1507,"The outcome of the summit was an agreement adopted by the states' parties that called for the US$100 billion per annum ""Green Climate Fund"", and a ""Climate Technology Centre"" and network."
1508,However the funding of the Green Climate Fund was not agreed upon.
1509,"Nor was a commitment to a second period of the Kyoto Protocol agreed upon, but it was concluded that the base year shall be 1990 and the global warming potentials shall be those provided by the IPCC."
1510,"All parties """"Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties,""""."
1511,It recognizes the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report goal of a maximum 2 °C global warming and all parties should take urgent action to meet this goal.
1512,"It also agreed upon greenhouse gas emissions should peak as soon as possible, but recognizing that the time frame for peaking will be longer in developing countries, since social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries."
1513,"The 2011 COP 17 was held in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011."
1514,"The conference agreed to a start negotiations on a legally binding deal comprising all countries, to be adopted in 2015, governing the period post 2020."
1515,There was also progress regarding the creation of a Green Climate Fund (GCF) for which a management framework was adopted.
1516,The fund is to distribute US$100 billion per year to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts.
1517,"While the president of the conference, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, declared it a success, scientists and environmental groups warned that the deal was not sufficient to avoid global warming beyond 2 °C as more urgent action is needed."
1518,"Qatar hosted COP 18 which took place in Doha, Qatar, from 26 November to 7 December 2012."
1519,"The Conference produced a package of documents collectively titled ""The Doha Climate Gateway""."
1520,The documents collectively contained:
1521,The conference made little progress towards the funding of the Green Climate Fund.
1522,"Russia, Belarus and Ukraine objected at the end of the session, as they had a right to under the session's rules."
1523,"In closing the conference, the President said that he would note these objections in his final report."
1524,COP 19 was the 19th yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 9th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (the protocol having been developed under the UNFCCC's charter).
1525,"The conference was held in Warsaw, Poland from 11 to 23 November 2013."
1526,"On 1–12 December 2014, Lima, Peru hosted the 20th yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 10th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol (the protocol having been developed under the UNFCCC's charter)."
1527,The pre-COP conference was held in Venezuela.
1528,The COP 21 was held in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015.
1529,"Negotiations resulted in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on 12 December, governing climate change reduction measures from 2020."
1530,"The adoption of this agreement ended the work of the Durban platform, established during COP17."
1531,The agreement will enter into force (and thus become fully effective) on 4 November 2016.
1532,On 4 October 2016 the threshold for adoption was reached with over 55 countries representing at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratifying the Agreement.
1533,"COP 22 was held in Marrakech, in the North-African country of Morocco, on 7–18 November 2016."

1546,"COP 25 was then planned to take place in Parque Bicentenario Cerrillos in Santiago de Chile, Chile from 2 to 13 December with a pre-sessional period from 26 November to 1 December 2019 with up to 25,000 delegates scheduled to attend."
1547,"However, following the 2019 Chilean protests, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera announced Chile's withdrawal from hosting the summit in late October 2019."
1548,"UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa stated that organizers were ""exploring alternative hosting options""."
1549,"Then Spain offered, and was appointed, as the new host."
1550,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are a group of small island countries that tend to share similar sustainable development challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on international trade, and fragile environments."
1551,"Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and infrastructure due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create economies of scale."
1552,The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992.
1553,The Barbados Programme of Action was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts.
1554,"The United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states."
1555,"Many SIDS now recognise the need to move towards low-carbon, climate resilient economies, as set out in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development."
1556,"SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports."
1557,Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable.
1558,Barbados has been successful in adopting the use of solar water heaters (SWHs).
1559,"A 2012 report published by the Climate & Development Knowledge Network showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations."
1560,These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s.
1561,The report suggested that Barbados's experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.
1562,"Currently, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs lists 57 small island developing states."
1563,"These are broken down into three geographic regions: the Caribbean; the Pacific; and Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS)., including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions."
1564,"Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the Caribbean Community, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Commission respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of."
1565,"In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the United Nations system."
1566,"The UNCTAD website states that ""the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS"" but it maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes."
1567,Competition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both the organisms or species are harmed.
1568,"Limited supply of at least one resource (such as food, water, and territory) used by both can be a factor."
1569,"Competition both within and between species is an important topic in ecology, especially community ecology."
1570,Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure.
1571,"Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition."
1572,"Competition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion."
1573,"According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources should either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems."
1574,"According to evolutionary theory, this competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection."
1575,"However, competition may play less of a role than expansion among larger clades; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis."
1576,"Competition occurs by various mechanisms, which can generally be divided into direct and indirect."
1577,These apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition.
1578,Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition.
1579,"During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources."
1580,"For example, large aphids defend feeding sites on cottonwood leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites."
1581,"In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources."
1582,"For example, plants consume nitrogen by absorbing it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants."
1583,"Plants that produce many roots typically reduce soil nitrogen to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants."
1584,Interference competition occurs directly between individuals via aggression etc.
1585,"when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat."
1586,"An example of this can be seen between the ant ""Novomessor cockerelli"" and red harvester ants, where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their colonies with small rocks."
1587,Exploitation competition occurs indirectly through a common limiting resource which acts as an intermediate.
1588,"For example, use of resources depletes the amount available to others, or they compete for space."
1589,Apparent competition occurs indirectly between two species which are both preyed upon by the same predator.
1590,"For example, species A and species B are both prey of predator C. The increase of species A may cause the decrease of species B, because the increase of As may aid in the survival of predator Cs, which will increase the number of predator Cs, which in turn will hunt more of species B."
1591,"Competition varies from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size-asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource)."
1592,"The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g."
1593,in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.
1594,"Competition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition."
1595,Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time).
1596,This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows.
1597,"Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited."
1598,Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce.
1599,This reduces population size and slows population growth.
1600,Species also interact with other species that require the same resources.
1601,"Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time."
1602,"Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct."
1603,These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.
1604,Intraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same resources in an ecosystem.
1605,Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area.
1606,"If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species."
1607,"Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species."
1608,"An example among animals could be the case of cheetahs and lions; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other."
1609,"In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs."
1610,"Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called 'intraguild predation'."
1611,"For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals)."
1612,"An example among protozoa involves ""Paramecium aurelia"" and ""Paramecium caudatum."
1613,"Russian ecologist, Georgy Gause, studied the competition between the two species of ""Paramecium"" that occurred as a result of their coexistence."
1614,"Through his studies, Gause proposed the Competitive exclusion principle, observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped."
1615,"Competition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups."
1616,"For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event."
1617,"In evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the selection of traits which promote success in particular environments."
1618,The theory originates from work on island biogeography by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson.
1619,"In r/K selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: ""r""- or ""K""-selection."
1620,"These terms, r and K, are derived from standard ecological algebra, as illustrated in the simple Verhulst equation of population dynamics:"
1621,"where ""r"" is the growth rate of the population (""N""), and ""K"" is the carrying capacity of its local environmental setting."
1622,"Typically, r-selected species exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each of whom has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood."
1623,"In contrast, K-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and invest more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood."
1624,"To explain how species coexist, in 1934 Georgii Gause proposed the competitive exclusion principle which is also called the Gause principle: species cannot coexist if they have the same ecological niche."
1625,"The word ""niche"" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction."
1626,These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper habitat conditions (like temperature or pH).
1627,Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources.
1628,"If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area."
1629,"Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist."
1630,Competition can cause species to evolve differences in traits.
1631,This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition.
1632,These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors.
1633,"Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations."
1634,"For example, Darwin's finches can be found alone or together on the Galapagos Islands."
1635,Both species' populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present.
1636,"However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate sized seeds."
1637,"Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks."
1638,"Different finch species can coexist if they have traits—for instance, beak size—that allow them to specialize on particular resources."
1639,"When ""Geospiza fortis"" and ""Geospiza fuliginosa"" are present on the same island, ""G. fuliginosa"" tends to evolve a small beak and ""G. fortis"" a large beak."
1640,The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement.
1641,"For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species."
1642,Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.
1643,"Earth's climate arises from the interaction of five major climate system components: the atmosphere (air), the hydrosphere (water), the cryosphere (ice and permafrost), the lithosphere (earth's upper rocky layer) and the biosphere (living things)."
1644,"Climate"" is the average weather, typically over a period of 30 years, and is determined by a combination of processes in the climate system, such as ocean currents and wind patterns."
1645,Circulation in the atmosphere and oceans is primarily driven by solar radiation and transports heat from the tropical regions to regions that receive less energy from the Sun.
1646,The water cycle also moves energy throughout the climate system.
1647,"In addition, different chemical elements, necessary for life, are constantly recycled between the different components."
1648,The climate system can change due to internal variability and external forcings.
1649,"These external forcings can be natural, such as variations in solar intensity and volcanic eruptions, or caused by humans."
1650,"Accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mainly being emitted by people burning fossil fuels, is causing global warming."
1651,"Human activity also releases cooling aerosols, but their net effect is far less than that of greenhouse gases."
1652,Changes can be amplified by feedback processes in the different climate system components.
1653,"The ""atmosphere"" envelops the earth and extends hundreds of kilometres from the surface."
1654,"It consists mostly of inert nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%) and argon (0.9%)."
1655,"Some trace gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapour and carbon dioxide, are the gases most important for the workings of the climate system, as they are greenhouse gases which allow visible light from the Sun to penetrate to the surface, but block some of the infra-red radiation the Earth's surface emits to balance the Sun's radiation."
1656,This causes surface temperatures to rise.
1657,The hydrological cycle is the movement of water through the atmosphere.
1658,"Not only does the hydrological cycle determine patterns of precipitation, it also has an influence on the movement of energy throughout the climate system."
1659,"The ""hydrosphere"" proper contains all the liquid water on Earth, with most of it contained in the world's oceans."
1660,"The ocean covers 71% of Earth's surface to an average depth of nearly , and can hold substantially more heat than the atmosphere."
1661,"It contains seawater with a salt content of about 3.5% on average, but this varies spatially."
1662,"Brackish water is found in estuaries and some lakes, and most freshwater, 2.5% of all water, is held in ice and snow."
1663,"The ""cryosphere"" contains all parts of the climate system where water is solid."
1664,"This includes sea ice, ice sheets, permafrost and snow cover."
1665,"Because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere, a larger part of that hemisphere is covered in snow."
1666,Both hemispheres have about the same amount of sea ice.
1667,"Most frozen water is contained in the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica, which average about in height."
1668,These ice sheets slowly flow towards their margins.
1669,"The ""Earth's crust,"" specifically mountains and valleys, shapes global wind patterns: vast mountain ranges form a barrier to winds and impact where and how much it rains."
1670,Land closer to open ocean has a more moderate climate than land farther from the ocean.
1671,"For the purpose of modelling the climate, the land is often considered static as it changes very slowly compared to the other elements that make up the climate system."
1672,The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation.
1673,"The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate."
1674,"Lastly, the ""biosphere"" also interacts with the rest of the climate system."
1675,"Vegetation is often darker or lighter than the soil beneath, so that more or less of the Sun's heat gets trapped in areas with vegetation."
1676,"Vegetation is good at trapping water, which is then taken up by its roots."
1677,"Without vegetation, this water would have run off to the closest rivers or other water bodies."
1678,"Water taken up by plants instead evaporates, contributing to the hydrological cycle."
1679,Precipitation and temperature influences the distribution of different vegetation zones.
1680,Carbon assimilation from seawater by the growth of small phytoplankton is almost as much as land plants from the atmosphere.
1681,"While humans are technically part of the biosphere, they are often treated as a separate components of Earth's climate system, the ""anthroposphere,"" because of human's large impact on the planet."
1682,"The climate system receives energy from the Sun, and to a far lesser extent from the Earth's core, as well as tidal energy from the Moon."
1683,The Earth gives off energy to outer space in two forms: it directly reflects a part of the radiation of the Sun and it emits infra-red radiation as black-body radiation.
1684,"The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth's energy budget."
1685,"When the total of incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, Earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming."
1686,"If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and Earth experiences cooling."
1687,More energy reaches the tropics than the polar regions and the subsequent temperature difference drives the global circulation of the atmosphere and oceans.
1688,"Air rises when it warms, flows polewards and sinks again when it cools, returning to the equator."
1689,"Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the Earth's rotation diverts the air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere, thus forming distinct atmospheric cells."
1690,"Monsoons, seasonal changes in wind and precipitation that occur mostly in the tropics, form due to the fact that land masses heat up more easily than the ocean."
1691,"The temperature difference induces a pressure difference between land and ocean, driving a steady wind."
1692,Ocean water that has more salt has a higher density and differences in density play an important role in ocean circulation.
1693,The thermohaline circulation transports heat from the tropics to the polar regions.
1694,Ocean circulation is further driven by the interaction with wind.
1695,The salt component also influences the freezing point temperature.
1696,"Vertical movements can bring up colder water to the surface in a process called upwelling, which cools down the air above."
1697,The hydrological cycle or water cycle describes how it is constantly moved between the surface of the Earth and the atmosphere.
1698,"Plants evapotranspirate and sunlight evaporates water from oceans and other water bodies, leaving behind salt and other minerals."
1699,The evaporated freshwater later rains back onto the surface.
1700,"Precipitation and evaporation are not evenly distributed across the globe, with some regions such as the tropics having more rainfall than evaporation, and others having more evaporation than rainfall."
1701,"The evaporation of water requires substantial quantities of energy, whereas a lot of heat is released during condensation."
1702,"This ""latent heat"" is the primary source of energy in the atmosphere."
1703,"Chemical elements, vital for life, are also constantly cycled through the different components of the climate system."
1704,The carbon cycle is directly important for climate as it determines the concentrations of two important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: and methane.
1705,"In the fast part of the carbon cycle, plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using photosynthesis; this is later re-emitted by the breathing of living creatures."
1706,"As part of the slow carbon cycle, volcanoes release by degassing, releasing carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust and mantle."
1707,"As in the atmosphere makes rain a bit acidic, this rain can slowly dissolve some rocks, a process known as ""weathering""."
1708,"The minerals that are released in this way, transported to the sea, are used by living creatures whose remains can form sedimentary rocks, bringing the carbon back to the lithosphere."
1709,The nitrogen cycle describes the flow of active nitrogen.
1710,"As atmospheric nitrogen is inert, micro-organisms first have to convert this to an active nitrogen compound in a process called ""fixing nitrogen"", before it can be used as a building block in the biosphere."
1711,"Human activities play an important role in both carbon and nitrogen cycles: the burning of fossil fuels has displaced carbon from the lithosphere to the atmosphere, and the use of fertilizers has vastly increased the amount of available fixed nitrogen."
1712,"Climate is constantly varying, on timescales that range from seasons to the lifetime of the Earth."
1713,"Changes caused by the system's own components and dynamics are called ""internal climate variability""."
1714,"The system can also experience ""external forcing"" from phenomena outside of the system (e.g."
1715,a change in Earth's orbit).
1716,"Longer changes, usually defined as changes that persist for at least 30 years, are referred to as ""climate changes"", although this phrase usually refers to the current global climate change."
1717,"When the climate changes, the effects may build on each other, cascading through the other parts of the system in a series of climate feedbacks (e.g."
1718,"albedo changes), producing many different effects (e.g."
1719,sea level rise).
1720,"Components of the climate system vary continuously, even without external pushes (external forcing)."
1721,"One example in the atmosphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which operates as an atmospheric pressure see-saw."
1722,"The Portuguese Azores typically have high pressure, whereas there is often lower pressure over Iceland."
1723,The difference in pressure oscillates and this affects weather patterns across the North Atlantic region up to central Eurasia.
1724,"For instance, the weather in Greenland and Canada is cold and dry during a positive NAO."
1725,Different phases of the North Atlantic oscillation can be sustained for multiple decades.
1726,The ocean and atmosphere can also work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time.
1727,"Examples of this type of variability include the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."
1728,"These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmosphere; but also by altering the cloud, water vapour or sea ice distribution, which can affect the total energy budget of the earth."
1729,"The oceanic aspects of these oscillations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than the atmosphere, and therefore very high thermal inertia."
1730,"For example, alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world's oceans."
1731,Understanding internal variability helped scientists to attribute recent climate change to greenhouse gases.
1732,"On long timescales, the climate is determined mostly by how much energy is in the system and where it goes."
1733,"When the Earth's energy budget changes, the climate follows."
1734,"A change in the energy budget is called a forcing, and when the change is caused by something outside of the five components of the climate system, it is called an ""external forcing""."
1735,"Volcanoes, for example, result from deep processes within the earth that are not considered part of the climate system."
1736,"Off-planet changes, such as solar variation and incoming asteroids, are also ""external"" to the climate system's five components, as are human actions."
1737,The Sun is the predominant source of energy input to the Earth and drives atmospheric circulation.
1738,"The amount of energy coming from the Sun varies on shorter time scales, including the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term time scales."
1739,"While the solar cycle is too small to directly warm and cool Earth's surface, it does influence a higher layer of the atmosphere directly, the stratosphere, which may have an effect on the atmosphere near the surface."
1740,"Slight variations in the Earth's motion can cause large changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe, although not to the global and yearly average sunlight."
1741,"The three types of kinematic change are variations in Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis."
1742,"Together these produce Milankovitch cycles, which affect climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods."
1743,Greenhouse gases trap heat in the lower part of the atmosphere by absorbing longwave radiation.
1744,"In the Earth's past, many processes contributed to variations in greenhouse gas concentrations."
1745,"Currently, emissions by humans are the cause of increasing concentrations of some greenhouse gases, such as , methane and ."
1746,"The dominant contributor to the greenhouse effect is water vapour (~50%), with clouds (~25%) and (~20%) also playing an important role."
1747,"When concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases such as are increased and temperature rises, the amount of water vapour increases as well, so that water vapour and clouds are not seen as external forcings, but instead as feedbacks."
1748,Rock weathering is a very slow process that removes carbon from the atmosphere.
1749,"Liquid and solid particles in the atmosphere, collectively named ""aerosols"", have diverse effects on the climate."
1750,"Some primarily scatter sunlight and thereby cool the planet, while others absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere."
1751,"Indirect effects include the fact that aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei, stimulating cloud formation."
1752,"Natural sources of aerosols include sea spray, mineral dust and volcanoes, but humans also contribute as the combustion of fossil fuels releases aerosols into the atmosphere."
1753,"Aerosols counteract a part of the warming effects of emitted greenhouse gases, but only until they fall back to the surface in a few years or less."
1754,"Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere, which itself is part of the climate system, volcanism is defined as an external forcing agent."
1755,"On average, there are only several volcanic eruptions per century that influence Earth's climate for longer than a year by ejecting tons of SO into the stratosphere."
1756,The sulfur dioxide is chemically converted into aerosols that cause cooling by blocking a fraction of sunlight to the Earth's surface.
1757,Small eruptions affect the atmosphere only subtly.
1758,"Deforestation, or other changes to human use of the land, can affect the climate."
1759,"The reflectivity of the area can change, causing the region to capture more or less sunlight."
1760,"In addition, vegetation interacts with the hydrological cycle, so that precipitation is also affected."
1761,"Landscape fires release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and release black carbon, which darkens snow making it easier to melt."
1762,The different elements of the climate system respond to external forcing in different ways.
1763,One important difference between the components is the speed at which they react to a forcing.
1764,"The atmosphere typically responds within a couple of hours to weeks, while the deep ocean and ice sheets take centuries to millennia to reach a new equilibrium."
1765,The initial response of a component to an external forcing can be damped by negative feedbacks and enhanced by positive feedbacks.
1766,"For example, a significant decrease of solar intensity would quickly lead to a temperature decrease on Earth, which would then allow ice and snow cover to expand."
1767,"The extra snow and ice has a higher albedo or reflectivity, and therefore reflects more of the Sun's radiation back into space before it can be absorbed by the climate system as a whole; this in turn causes the Earth to cool down further."
1768,"Ablation zone or ""ablation area"" refers to the low-altitude area of a glacier or ice sheet below firn with a net loss in ice mass due to melting, sublimation, evaporation, ice calving, aeolian processes like blowing snow, avalanche, and any other ablation."
1769,The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) or snow line separates the ablation zone from the higher-altitude accumulation zone.
1770,"The ablation zone often contains meltwater features such as supraglacial lakes, englacial streams, and subglacial lakes."
1771,Sediments dropped in the ablation zone forming small mounds or hillocks are called kames.
1772,Kame and kettle hole topography is useful in identifying an ablation zone of a glacier.
1773,The seasonally melting glacier deposits much sediment at its fringes in the ablation area.
1774,Ablation constitutes a key part of the glacier mass balance.
1775,The amount of snow and ice gained in the accumulation zone and the amount of snow and ice lost in the ablation zone determine glacier mass balance.
1776,Often mass balance measurements are made in the ablation zone using snow stakes.
1777,So Much So Fast is a documentary film written and directed by Academy Award nominees Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan.
1778,"It premiered in competition at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and won the Audience Award at the Boston Independent Film Festival."
1779,"So Much So Fast"" documents 5 years in the life of Stephen Heywood who, at 29, discovers he had the paralyzing neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease)."
1780,"Determined to live as well as possible, Stephen gets married, has a son and rebuilds two houses."
1781,His and his wife Wendy’s observations of the world and his disease explore the fragility of life.
1782,"The film also tracks his family's response to the drug companies that ignore his disease because there is not enough profit in curing it, and his brother, Jamie Heywood's, creation of the ALS Therapy Development Foundation research facility to find a cure for Stephen's disease in time."
1783,The Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) is a structured forum for discussing important issues in energy and the environment.
1784,The EMF was established in 1976 at Stanford University.
1785,"The EMF works through a series of ad hoc working groups, each focussing on a particular corporate or policy decision."
1786,The EMF provides a non-partisan platform that ensures objective consideration of opposing views.
1787,Participation is by invitation.
1788,"Since the late-1990s, the EMF has made contributions to the economics of climate change, as witnessed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and on integrated assessment modeling more generally."
1789,John Weyant is the current director of the EMF.
1790,"The EMF was convened in 1976 over concerns that the insights that large-scale energy models could provide policymakers were being overshadowed by the ""plethora of detailed quantitative results"" being disseminated and discussed."
1791,"As a result, the EMF sought to bring energy modelers together to provide a proper context for their work."
1792,"Indeed, the EMF was ""formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis""."
1793,The EMF periodically establishes working groups to conduct studies on selected energy topics.
1794,A working group then identifies relevant existing models and sets a series of tests to illuminate the basic structure and behavior of each model.
1795,Results are compared and the strengths and weaknesses of each model is documented in a (as of 1982) freely available report.
1796,Reports for most of the completed projects are available from the EMF website.
1797,Reports since 2006 have sometimes been published exclusively in special editions of (paywalled) academic journals instead.
1798,Friends of the Earth (FoE) Australia is a federation of independent local groups working for a socially equitable and environmentally sustainable future.
1799,"It believes that pursuing environmental protection is inseparable from broader social concerns, and as a result uses an environmental justice perspective in its campaigning."
1800,It was founded in 1974 and is the Australian member of Friends of the Earth International.
1801,"Friends of the Earth considers environmental issues in their social, political and human rights contexts."
1802,"Their campaigns stretch beyond the traditional arena of the conservation movement and seek to address the economic, social justice and development aspects of sustainability."
1803,The current national campaigns and projects of FoEA are:
1804,"A climate justice perspective addresses global warming by looking at who is harmed by climatic change, and how, and who is responsible for the emissions that caused the warming."
1805,In practical terms this means FoEA campaigns for Australia to reduce its carbon emissions to a 'globally equitable' level whilst also agreeing to accept a quota of 'climate refugees'.
1806,In 2009 it launched the Coalition for Climate Displacement and also broadened its campaign work into state based activity against the expansion of coal mining and export.
1807,The current main focus of its climate campaign is to oppose an expansion of Australia's reliance on coal and to promote a shift to low carbon sources of energy production.
1808,"Since its inception, FoEA has campaigned against all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle."
1809,"At present this includes the radioactive waste dump proposed for the Northern Territory and all existing uranium mines, including the Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs in South Australia."
1810,The co-ordinator of its national nuclear campaign is Jim Green.
1811,"FoEA is calling for a moratorium on the research, development and production of synthetic nanoproducts while regulations are developed to protect the health and safety of workers, the public and the environment from the impacts of nanotechnology."
1812,"FoEA campaigns on a range of industrial chemicals issues, particularly the use of Bisphenol A in consumer products and use of pesticides in drinking water catchments."
1813,The FoEA Sustainable Food and Agriculture Project addresses issues of social justice and environmental sustainability in contemporary food and farming systems.
1814,Many local FoE groups work in partnership with Indigenous communities.
1815,FoE acts as the secretariat for the Australian Nuclear Free Alliance (ANFA).
1816,"In addition to more conventional campaigning, a number of FoE groups operate businesses and other ventures that act as practical examples of sustainable business."
1817,"In 1999 FoE Brisbane initiated the Reverse Garbage re-use centre, which finds community uses for industrial discards which would otherwise go to landfill."
1818,The Bicycle Revolution (which finds and fixes up old pushbikes) also operates from FoE Brisbane.
1819,"FoE in Melbourne has been running a large food co-operative and a bookshop for over two decades and, more recently an organic café."
1820,The local groups generate their own funds.
1821,"National campaigns and projects rely on individual donations, foundations, merchandise, and bequests."
1822,FoE Australia currently receives no government or corporate funding.
1823,FoE Australia sits at the left end of the political spectrum.
1824,"While it is a 'peak' green group, it is one of the smaller such groups."
1825,"It tends to operate from a grassroots political structure, which means it places less emphasis on lobbying of, or engagement with, either the federal Australian government or large corporations than most other national green groups."
1826,"It uses research, lobbying, media work, political advocacy and peaceful direct action to achieve its aims."
1827,It is known for developing lasting connections with a range of indigenous communities and organisations over areas of shared interest.
1828,"It has been criticised for carrying out non-violent direct action by a range of conservative commentators (for instance, Andrew Bolt, columnist with the Herald Sun newspaper in Melbourne)."
1829,Andrew Bolt has also accused them of being 'alarmist' on the question of climate change.
1830,Some groups and people concerned about the impacts of population growth have been critical of FoE's focus on consumption and equity in regards to resource distribution and called on the organisation to campaign more directly for a reduction in human population.
1831,"The carbon bubble is a hypothesized bubble in the valuation of companies dependent on fossil-fuel-based energy production, because the true costs of carbon dioxide in intensifying global warming are not yet taken into account in a company's stock market valuation."
1832,Currently the price of fossil fuels companies' shares is calculated under the assumption that all fossil fuel reserves will be consumed.
1833,An estimate made by Kepler Chevreux puts the loss in value of the fossil fuel companies due to the impact of the growing renewables industry at US$28 trillion over the next two decades-long.
1834,A more recent analysis made by Citi puts that figure at $100 trillion.
1835,"Analysts in both the petroleum and financial industries are concluding that the ""age of oil"" has already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue to prevail in the future."
1836,A consensus appears to be emerging that an international agreement will be reached to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 °C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels.
1837,"According to the UK's Committee on Climate Change, overvaluing companies that produce fossil fuels and greenhouse gases poses a serious threat to the economy."
1838,The committee warned the British government and Bank of England of the risks of the carbon bubble in 2014.
1839,"The following year, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in his lecture to Lloyd's of London, warned that limiting global warming to 2 °C appears to require that the ""vast majority"" of fossil fuel reserves be ""stranded assets"", or ""literally unburnable without expensive carbon-capture technology"", resulting in ""potentially huge"" exposure to investors in that sector."
1840,"He concluded that ""the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking"" for responding to the threat that climate change poses to financial resilience and longer-term prosperity, which he called the ""tragedy of the horizon""."
1841,"That same month, the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England issued a report discussing the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the insurance industry."
1842,"In his speech announcing his denial of the proposal to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline, United States President Barack Obama gave as one reason for the decision ""... ultimately, if we’re going to prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we’re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground...""."
1843,"The term ""carbon bubble"" arose in the early 21st century from the increasing awareness of the impact of fossil fuel combustion on global temperatures."
1844,The term was coined by the Carbon Tracker Initiative which published key reports in July 2011 and April 2013. and it was further popularised in the New Scientist magazine in October 2011.
1845,"A widely shared article by Bill McKibben was published in Rolling Stone magazine in July 2012, bringing the idea to the attention of a popular audience."
1846,These were followed later in 2013 by a report from the Demos think tank.
1847,"Author Bill McKibben has estimated that to sustain human life in the world, up to $20 trillion worth of fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground."
1848,"The Stern report in 2006 stated that the benefits of strong, early action to decrease the use of oil, coal and gas considerably outweigh the costs."
1849,"Fossil fuel contributors, the building industry, and land use practices ignore the responsibility of the external costs and ignore the polluter pays principle according to which climate change costs will be paid by historical climate polluters."
1850,"A planned and orderly transition away from dependence on fossil fuels could prevent a disruptive ""bursting of the carbon bubble""."
1851,A number of developments are supporting such a transition.
1852,"The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21 or CMP 11 was held in Paris, France, from 30 November to 12 December 2015."
1853,It was the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
1854,"The conference negotiated the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change, the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 attending parties."
1855,The agreement enters into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
1856,"On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries signed the agreement in New York,"
1857,"According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks, the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2 °C"" Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels."
1858,The agreement calls for zero net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century.
1859,"In the adopted version of the Paris Agreement, the parties will also ""pursue efforts to"" limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C."
1860,"The 1.5 °C goal will require zero emissions sometime between 2030 and 2050, according to some scientists."
1861,"Prior to the conference, 146 national climate panels publicly presented a draft of national climate contributions (called ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"", INDCs)."
1862,These suggested commitments were estimated to limit global warming to 2.7 °C by 2100.
1863,"For example, the EU suggested INDC is a commitment to a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 1990."
1864,"The agreement establishes a ""global stocktake"" which revisits the national goals to ""update and enhance"" them every five years beginning 2023."
1865,"However, no detailed timetable or country-specific goals for emissions were incorporated into the Paris Agreement – as opposed to the previous Kyoto Protocol."
1866,"A number of meetings took place in preparation for COP21, including the Bonn Climate Change Conference, 19 to 23 October 2015, which produced a draft agreement."
1867,"According to the organizing committee of the summit in Paris, the objective of the 2015 conference was to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate."
1868,"Pope Francis published an encyclical called ""Laudato si'"" intended, in part, to influence the conference."
1869,"The encyclical calls for action against climate change: "" Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it."
1870,"The International Trade Union Confederation has called for the goal to be ""zero carbon, zero poverty"", and its general secretary Sharan Burrow has repeated that there are ""no jobs on a dead planet""."
1871,The location of UNFCCC talks is rotated by regions throughout United Nations countries.
1872,The 2015 conference was held at Le Bourget from 30 November to 12 December 2015.
1873,"To some extent, France served as a model country for delegates attending COP21 because it is one of the few developed countries in the world to decarbonize electricity production and fossil fuel energy while still providing a high standard of living."
1874,"As of 2012, France generated over 90% of its electricity from zero carbon sources, including nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind."
1875,"The conference took place two weeks after a series of terrorist attacks in the 8th ward of Paris, Saint-Denis."
1876,"Marshall law was declared and national security was tightened accordingly, with 30,000 police officers and 285 security checkpoints deployed across the country until after the conference ended."
1877,"The European Union and 195 nations (""see list in reference"") were the participating parties."
1878,The overarching goal of the Convention is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase.
1879,Since COP 17 this increase is set at above pre-industrial levels.
1880,"However, Christiana Figueres acknowledged in the closing briefing at the 2012 Doha conference: ""The current pledges under the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol are clearly not enough to guarantee that the temperature will stay below 2 °C and there is an ever increasing gap between the action of countries and what the science tells us."
1881,"During previous climate negotiations, countries agreed to outline actions they intended to take within a global agreement, by 1 October 2015."
1882,These commitments are known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs.
1883,"Together, the INDCs would reduce global warming from an estimated 4–5 °C (by 2100) to 2.7 °C, and reduce emissions per capita by 9% by 2030, while providing hope in the eyes of the conference organizers for further reductions in the future that would allow meeting a 2 °C target."
1884,"Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) argued that the keys to success lay in convincing officials in the U.S. and China, by far the two largest national emitters:"
1885,"As long as policy makers in Washington and Beijing didn't put all their political capital behind the adoption of ambitious carbon-emission capping targets, the laudable efforts of other G20 governments often remained in the realm of pious wishes."
1886,Things changed for the better on 12 November 2014 when President Obama and General Secretary Xi Jinping agreed to limit greenhouse gases emissions.
1887,"President Obama insisted on America's essential role in that regard: ""We've led by example [...] from Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains [...] we've seen the longest streak of private job creation in our history."
1888,We've driven our economic output to all time-highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades.
1889,"And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divide between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long [...] That was the foundation for success in Paris."
1890,"On 12 December 2015, the participating 196 countries agreed, by consensus, to the final global pact, the Paris Agreement, to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas."
1891,"In the 12-page document, the members agreed to reduce their carbon output ""as soon as possible"" and to do their best to keep global warming ""to well below 2 degrees C""."
1892,"In the course of the debates, island states of the Pacific, the Seychelles, but also the Philippines, their very existence threatened by sea level rise, had strongly voted for setting a goal of 1.5 °C instead of only 2 °C."
1893,"France's Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, said this ""ambitious and balanced"" plan was an ""historic turning point"" in the goal of reducing global warming."
1894,"However, some others criticized the fact that significant sections are ""promises"" or aims and not firm commitments by the countries."
1895,The Agreement will not become binding on its member states until 55 parties who produce over 55% of the world's greenhouse gas have ratified the Agreement.
1896,"There is doubt whether some countries, especially the United States, will agree to do so, though the United States publicly committed, in a joint Presidential Statement with China, to joining the Agreement in 2016."
1897,"Each country that ratifies the agreement will be required to set a target for emission reduction or limitation, called a ""nationally determined contribution,"" or ""NDC,"" but the amount will be voluntary."
1898,There will be neither a mechanism to force a country to set a target by a specific date nor enforcement measures if a set target is not met.
1899,"There will be only a ""name and shame"" system or, as János Pásztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, told CBS News, a ""name and encourage"" plan."
1900,"Some analysts have also observed that the stated objectives of the Paris Agreement are implicitly ""predicated upon an assumption – that member states of the United Nations, including high polluters such as China, US, India, Canada, Russia, Indonesia and Australia, which generate more than half the world's greenhouse gas emissions, will somehow drive down their carbon pollution voluntarily and assiduously without any binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control CO emissions at any level from factory to state, and without any specific penalty gradation or fiscal pressure (for example a carbon tax) to discourage bad behaviour."
1901,"Speaking at the 5th annual World Pensions Forum held on the sidelines of the COP21 Summit, Earth Institute Director Jeffrey Sachs argued that institutional investors would eventually divest from carbon-reliant firms if they could not react to political and regulatory efforts to halt climate change: ""Every energy company in a pension fund's portfolio needs to be scrutinized from purely a financial view about its future, 'Why is this [a company] we would want to hold over a five- to 20-year period?'..."
1902,"If we continue to hold major energy companies that don't have an answer to a basic financial test, we are just gambling."
1903,We have to take a fiduciary responsibility – these are not good bets.
1904,"Some US policy makers concurred, notably Al Gore, insisting that ""no agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement."
1905,"As is usual before such major conferences, major NGOs and groups of governments have drafted and published a wide variety of declarations they intend to seek a consensus on, at the Paris conference itself."
1906,These include at least the following major efforts:
1907,The conference was budgeted to cost €170m (US$186.87m at the time).
1908,"The French government said that 20% of the cost would be borne by French firms such as EDF, Engie (formerly known as GDF Suez), Air France, Renault-Nissan and BNP Paribas."
1909,"Around the world, 600,000 took part in demonstrations in favour of a strong agreement, such as the Global Climate March organized by 350.org (and other events such as Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives)."
1910,"Paris had a ban on public gatherings in the wake of recent terrorist attacks (state of emergency), but allowed thousands to demonstrate on 12 December against what they felt was a too-weak treaty."
